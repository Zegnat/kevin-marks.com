<p>We're webcasting the Homebrew Website Club at https://talky.io/hwc
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>The Homebrew Computer Club started when microprocessors got cheap enough for individuals - in 1975
<p>I have a software update pending on my Mac and iPod that will force me to use iCloud - timesharing returns
<p>Lee would say "Welcome to the Homebrew Website Club, which does not exist"
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://joel.franusic.com'>Joël Franusic</a>:  <blockquote><p>I host my own domain using the github tool Jekyll, but I want OpenStreetMap, Wikipedia et al on my computer
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com'>Kevin Marks</a>:  <blockquote><p>I hack on indieweb stuff. I have my stuff at kevinmarks.com on a static site
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://benwerd.com/'>Ben Werdmuller</a>:  <blockquote><p>I've been running my own domain on WordPress but I wanted to make my own, hence idno
<p>I was really interested in POSSE - lots of people don't understand sending things out from your own site
<p>I care about giving people meaningful control without losing functionality
<p>I'm also interested in how indieweb and POSSE applies to companies as well as individuals
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://pius.me'>Pius</a>:  <blockquote><p>I'm at pius.me I'm interested in the domain name as the new phone number - I want to get a domain+services for non-tech
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://iboxifoo.com/'>John Rogerson</a>:  <blockquote><p>I used @al3x's Sovereign to set up a lot of services on my own domain using ansible
<p>this gets me ownCloud - like dropbox, calendar, webserver, etc - paying $20/mo + an SSL cert for $100
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>I like that people are taking different approaches and solving different problems
<p>WordPress and Drupal are like minicomputers - the expense is not money but time learning how to hack
<p>each has community, but there is almost an initiation rite that make you commit to 1 codebase to rule them all
<p>this monoculture antipattern is getting repeated over and over - appreciate we're doing different things
<p>there are different technical skills, and we appreciate that. Building blocks at indiewebcamp.com
<p>I want to solve how to do good event posts - seems like a hard problem, especially design and UX
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://benwerd.com/'>Ben Werdmuller</a>:  <blockquote><p>the invitations associated with an event are also important- we don't have a mechanism for that
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://about.me/jay.wong'>Jay Wong</a>:  <blockquote><p>I'm a UI designer. I have my own website at http://www.jaywong.co/ but I'm not happy with WordPress
<p>WordPress seems a lot heavier - everyone is trying to use it for ecommerce
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://matthewlevine.com/'>Matthew Levine</a>:  <blockquote><p>My site is matthewlevine.com-  it's mostly placeholder and pointers to other presences. It runs on AppEngine
<p>I'm interested in the UX of publishing itself, and in better ways to tell stories through websites
<p>I'm interested in the PESOS stuff, where POSSE falls short - fitbit does that will, but I want it on my site
<p>I want to use these other things to tell my own story on my own website
<p>it would be great to have activity stream compatible updates form all these devices, but it doesn't exist
<p>I'd like a proxy that translates the fitbit, Up etc sites into activity streams
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://snarfed.org/'>Ryan Barrett</a>:  <blockquote><p>I have a proxy that turns Facebook, Twitter G+ etc into activity streams, @matthewlevine we should talk
<p>everyone who makes self-tracking things has a different api
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com'>Kevin Marks</a>:  <blockquote><p>hardware people tend to make up their own formats even more than software people
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>it's handy when laziness and self-interest combine to make lockin
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://about.me/jay.wong'>Jay Wong</a>:  <blockquote><p>I want to have all my stuff in one place that is co-ordinated and under my control
<p>I want to have a website to organise my life
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://benwerd.com/'>Ben Werdmuller</a>:  <blockquote><p>the Personal Cloud movement seem to not want it to be a website, but more of a box
<p>I want to say 'these are mine, these are visible to you too'
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>by globally accsessible I want accsessible to me
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://snarfed.org/'>Ryan Barrett</a>:  <blockquote><p>when indieweb we focus on sharing to people first; personal cloud on things just for ourselves
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>we start from the simpler problem, because public is simpler
<p>you'll get to private faster if you do public first
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://matthewlevine.com/'>Matthew Levine</a>:  <blockquote><p>all the stuff that I want to be private, I want a record of every spend, but maybe a public summary
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>your transactions on VenMo by default are not private - your friends can favorite and comment on them
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://matthewlevine.com/'>Matthew Levine</a>:  <blockquote><p>I want to share with some people, not with everyone
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://pius.me'>Pius</a>:  <blockquote><p>Path is trying to be the place that you share everything with a few people.
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://about.me/jay.wong'>Jay Wong</a>:  <blockquote><p>Path is trying to build a narrative of your life, intertwined with friends, but reality, not public stuff
<p>with Path I have to narrate my own story; if I have a feed of expenses under my control I can do more
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://benwerd.com/'>Ben Werdmuller</a>:  <blockquote><p>if I'm looking at my life I want something like Mint, but under my control
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-author' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com'>Kevin Marks</a>:  <blockquote><p>I find Mint frustrating because it tells me things I already know and give bad pie charts
<p>Path I have stopped using because I wasn't sure what I had I wanted to share with that group specifically
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>the trap is 'why can't one person solve it' is false -we need a plurality of approaches
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://snarfed.org/'>Ryan Barrett</a>:  <blockquote><p>the other extreme is everyone has to write their own stack for themselves - we want a collection
<p>we don't want everyone to write code, but 
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>open source communities are engrained in there being only one service
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://pius.me'>Pius</a>:  <blockquote><p>we have these high level things like Medium, WordPress and low level like AWS we need things inbetween
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://matthewlevine.com/'>Matthew Levine</a>:  <blockquote><p>I like having a lot of examples that we learn from, with a curve people can climb up
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://about.me/jay.wong'>Jay Wong</a>:  <blockquote><p>I like Tumblr - it's like if Blogger 2005 had updated to 2013 - it's easy to make it nice.
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://matthewlevine.com/'>Matthew Levine</a>:  <blockquote><p>Tumblr makes it too easy to make nice themes - MySpace forced you to copy and paste HTML
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://iboxifoo.com/'>John Rogerson</a>:  <blockquote><p>you do worry if these thinsg are going to survive - Tumblr, Blogger will all rot.
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com'>Kevin Marks</a>:  <blockquote><p>I've been live tweeting with my indieweb tool www.noterlive.com
