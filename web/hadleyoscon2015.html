<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://hadleybeeman.net/'>Hadley Beeman</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>we believe that Open Source is stronger when it is supported by Open Standards
<p>with Open Standards we can switch what we are using underneath to whatever technology makes sense
<p>we have an open process to select software interoperability standards to make compulsory across government
<p>our standards choice is based at <a class="auto-link" href="http://standards.data.gov.uk">standards.data.gov.uk</a> and relentlessly focused on user need
<p>a couple of months ago we had a process for exchanging standards on address data, including vcard and h-card
<p>we need you to help us set these open standards - we have challenges on location, job listings and more
<p>you help us make these decisions on what to require, and we make them standard across government
<p>ultimately we want to build an ecosystem based on open source and open standards for all of government</blockquote>
