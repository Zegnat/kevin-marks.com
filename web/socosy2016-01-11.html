<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://serious.biz'>Jason U. Nadler</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>internetainment is bridging the gap between digital an television - digital you can make about 1/10 of what TV pays
<p>our show <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/midnight">@midnight</a> has a game we play called #hashtagwars which has kept us on the air 
<p>you want the biggest stage possible - sometimes that is digital, but if media matters at all TV is what they want
<p>in 2013 we created an app called Briandex that was an interactive show - a 10 question trivia show; 500k downloads
<p>there is power in the long tail, but there is power in the expensive creator space too - there is a disconnect
<p>youtube has the long tail; they're trying to work out how to remunerate the middle tail and compete with netflix
<p>as an advocate for the creator. the business model for tv is fantastic when it works; for digital it is not clear
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.bobmankoff.com/'>Bob Mankoff</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>the internet is hard to monetize, but maybe it is s different creative world - most don't make money in any case
<p>instead of everyone being a spectator, we have a world of creativity that in and of itself is valuable

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://serious.biz'>Jason U. Nadler</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>when snapchat tells me half a million people watched this snap I don't necessarily believe it

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://gavinpurcell.com'>Gavin Purcell</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>we get very different reactions to tonight show clips from people on facebook, youtube and twitter
<p>the late night TV shows are essentially a content factory - we can always have stuff to put out on the net

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.bobmankoff.com/'>Bob Mankoff</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>humour is essentially social, and so there is an ideal environment for it in these social networks
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://gavinpurcell.com'>Gavin Purcell</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>humor is exploding, criticism and anger shows are exploding because people want to feel something
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@melissaeccles'>Melissa Eccles</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>we make emotionally connected creative experiences, from mind controlled bikes to space shuttles through LA
<p>my job is to help people avoid reality as long as possible
<p>what we did for game of thrones was create a fan experience for them to see the future - greensight
<p>how do you quantify enchantment? - we looked at the psychographics of interaction
<p>fan service is not just merketing - it is creating things that give value to the fans over time
<p>when you connect to the fan groups, they will spread it to the less engaged people marketing is going for
<p>VR is great for creating immersion, but not at creating a way for you to react and act on it
<p>it doesn't matter which medium you start with, what matters is your story
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://bbcamerica.com'>Rachel Garcia</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>there are 400 TV shows competing for audiences, but they are also competing with everythgin that has ever been made
<p>people barely differentiate the entertainment from their facebook pages than from their TV shows
<p>our channel is still a primary destination that we want people to go to, but we embrace the digital shift
<p>with Doctor Who we had the challenge of building a cult phenomenon into mainstream hit
<p>with Doctor Who we stopped thinking about seasons and made it a year-round stategy
<p>we've gone from curating and celebrating fan activity to writing it into the show
<p>they have written cosplaying into the show, so now we have cosplayers playing cosplayers
<p>in a multi-channel univers, FOMO is the programmer's best friend 
<p>Doctor Who is a kids show in the UK
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.plasticbag.org/'>Tom Coates</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I've only watched every episode of Doctor Who since 1980, so I can't comment on all of it
<p>Doctor Who is not a kids show, it's a family show, and you have to know1 episode in 3 will be terrible
<p>is there a danger in making it too insular if it is about too much fan service
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://serious.biz'>Jason U. Nadler</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>you're the american licensor of doctor who - do you get dissonance with the UK people?

<p>Turing write a paper on organising unorganised machinery - but this was ignored until the last few years
<p>neural networks work by having successive layers of artificial neurons connected with weights, you adjust the weights
<p>depending what layer you amplify, you see different structures from the training
<p>this neuron has turtle-ness - there is no actual turtle in it
<p>we need not to over-anthropomorphise the deep dream images
<p>I think these are going to be good tools for creators by inspiring them with things to rebuild

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.miketyka.com/'>Mike Tyka</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>these images have a tendency to become very boring very quickly - we're not interested in what the machine thought

<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.miketyka.com/'>Mike Tyka</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>a lot of that is because the network was trained on animals so combining animals and people is always creepy

<p>I get hate speech, dox attacks, ddos of my site, campaigns to report me to the fbi
<p>The Wikipedia entry has been replaced with porn images, and endless requests to include conspiracy theories 
<p>When I posted a video to YouTube they campaigned to mass report me to YouTube 
<p>I was able to get YouTube to put my work back up, but other women targeted  may not have that reach 
<p>Perpetrators treat this as a game - they refer to us a bosses, and document attacks to show off to one another 
<p>Women who are harassed are told to toughen up and grow a thick skin, and that my threats are fake 
<p>We see a an aggressive denial of women's experiences -  we are told that we are making it up
<p>We need to fundamentally change the online networks structure to reduce these attacks 
<p>The other area of focus is the legal system - women who report abuse to police have their info given out to harassers 
<p>A colleague called the police to report a death threat, was treated as hysterical. They asked to speak to her husband 
<p>You can't be neutral on a moving train. We all need to be involved with fixing rhis

<p>If you don't get to see yourself in games, you miss out. 
<p>Most video game protagonists are 30 year old brown eyed white males 
<p>I love Witcher 3, but when I complained about diversity I was told it was Polish myth, despite it having dwarves 
<p>The game Rust randomised your race and gender, and white gamers freaked out at having to play black characters 
<p>I get to block over 100000 accounts on twitter because I asked for diversity. I have to use 3 blocking toools
<p>I worry now about boosting someone else's project in case it brings harassment to their door
<p>Online and real life are the same. Kill the phrase irl.

<p>Navigating gender transition online can be as hard as in the physical world 
<p>We often talk about online as  safe space for gender experimentation, but we see a lot of harassment for ir
<p>Especially in a "real name"  environment like Facebook trans people get attacked 
<p>"I experience sexism as a woman more than transphobic discrimination" 
<p>Facebook uses the terminology "authentic names" in opposition to 'fake"
<p>Facebook disallowing multiple accounts makes  it difficult to transition online

<p>Online sexual violence and threats are not "stranger danger" a lot use surveillance tactics 
<p>Violent partners will often break into your accounts to monitor you  and intimidate
<p>We have a death review committee in Ontario, we find attempts to isolate and threaten women 
<p>Survivors are also using social media to discuss their abuse

<p>teens are creating fake instagram accounts - closed accounts with fake names so they can post ugly selfies too
<p>instagram is a platform where you are expected to have a perfect photo, and finstagram is where you can be real
<p>teens create a space of deliberate imperfection online - how are teens reshaping tech to meet developmental needs?

<p>when my son was diagnosed with diabetes, we hacked all his monitoring devices so we could get the sugar data
<p>when we took it to the pediatriciain, they refused to look at the data, and made us fill in their tiny form

<p>what we see on vine and what we now see on black twitter is that the default audience is different
<p>vine is a remix culture, so these creators can't access the value they create because they don't have copyright

<p>they decided to compare the uncommon words between macbeth and other shakespeare plays
<p>knock tyrant and dagger were more common - and so were our and she
<p>now Macbeth is a story about a couple who commit murders -sorry spoilers
<p>the word that is used more often than any other in shakespeare is the word 'the'
<p>"it was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bellman which gives the stern'st good-night" - why 'the' not 'an' ?
<p>over and over again Macbeth has 'the' rather than 'an' or 'a' -it makes the other things more specific
<p>once this has been pointed out you can't unsee this use of 'the' in Macbeth to make everyday objects ominous

<p>Rape Culture assumes that sexual violence is an accepted norm - and media word choice reinforces this
<p>this reporter called a 30-year-old man having sex with a 13-year-old girl as 'a tryst'
<p>what this tells survivors that this is their fault, and that they can consent to statutory rape
<p>we made this guide on how to report sexual violence: <a class="auto-link" href="http://www.femifesto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/UseTheRightWords-Single-Dec3.pdf">http://www.femifesto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/UseTheRightWords-Single-Dec3.pdf</a>

<p>we have a conduit metaphor where we talk about conveying ideas with a model of flow
<p>engineers want to make communication more efficient so they try to rule out lying
<p>when kids are small, we teach them to lie to other people about their actual reactions
<p>if everyone was like a toddler who says exactly what they think, civilisation would collapse
<p>obligate communication of information would not be in the interest of the organism
