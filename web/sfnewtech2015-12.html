<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.motioninfusion.com/'>Laura Putnam</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>we love our chairs, but we are biologically programmed to move, which is a huge disconnect
<p>We need to do more Non-exercise activity - that is what makes the difference
<p>what happened with smoking was that we made it harder to smoke
<p>what if every chair came with a warning label? what if we banned office chairs?
<p>the more standing that you do the better - even 3 hours a day of sitting can be too much

<p>we have a label sharing tool for gmail between accounts, so you can build workflow using it
<p>we offer the gmail sync for free, but we charge for salesforce and live365 etc sync

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://about.me/pemullen'>Peter Mullen</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>Speakeasy was founded because the conference call was a broken dysfunctional business
<p>you will never need a PIN because you all have your own number
<p>you can have a backchannel based on email domain so you can chat without clients seeing you
<p>when you're through with the call, it will hang up and log you into salesforce to tack the call
<p>we're funded by bessemer ventures and salesforce and we're built on Twilio

<p>in the long run we want to create an ad network for it, now we are doing it as service to video producers

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.brianmaggi.com'>brianmaggi</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>our phones stopped being phones a while ago, and are now messaging mainly
<p>when you're having a chat back and forth the messages look like bubbles - we can add a meeting suggestion bubble
<p>I can throw in a quick poll in a bubble too and they can choose which coffee shop
<p>I can put 'where are you at?" in a bubble it will show you location and arrival time
<p>you can still work with this without the app, you'll get an SMS with a web link to the bubble
<p>this is a fremium productivity business like dropbox/evernote/slack not an ad business

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://go.massroots.com'>MassRoots</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>we're the worlds largest social network for cannabis users we have 600,000 users
<p>we got kicked out of the Apple store for being a social cannabis app, so we campaigned against Apple and got back in
<p>we were Parse's guinea pig for scaling -when we crossed 450,000 users it slowed down so we're moving to Amazon instead
<p>we provided weedmojis for people to try and 50,000 downloaded in 24 hours
<p>in 2013 we pitched VCs but they said cannabis was illegal under federal law, so we went public on our own
<p>Out stock ticker is $MSRT and our users have invested in us directly
<p>we collect user data and target ads based on users postings and can advertise dispensaries to them
<p>next year about 25% of voters will have cannabis legalization on the ballot, so we are working on voter registration
<p>If we can help change cannabis laws in various states, that will create great brand loyalty
<p>facebook started with college students and expanded to the mainstream, we started with the potheads and expand to medical
<p>q: do you have to be paid in cash? a number of community banks in colorado are now accepting cannabis accounts

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://go.massroots.com'>MassRoots</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>we have not done that, and we work hard to stop people posting about usage from states where it is illegal

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://greenrushdaily.com'>Green Rush Daily</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I'm eddie miller, chief strategy officer of greenrush - we are a cannabis delivery platform
<p>we're not the Uber of cannabis, we're more like GrubHub where you can order cannabis from dispensaries
<p>you either upload your medical marijuana card, or wen can get you one online through our doctors
<p>the promo code sfnewtech will get you 25% off your order tonight
<p>there is an entire industry out there that delivers cannabis to patients for credit cards we're prop #215 compliant
<p>our app is not in the app store - apple has not let us in-  go to our mobile web interface
<p>if you don't have a credit card, we verify your drivers licence and medical marijuana card with photos
