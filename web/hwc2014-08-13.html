<div class="e-content"><p><a class='h-card' href='http://katelosse.tv'>kate losse</a>:  <blockquote><p>I really like having my own website - you have access to analytics directly and who sees it 
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://erinjo.is'>Erin Jo Richey</a>:  <blockquote><p>I hear from a lot of the journalists I interview that seeing traffic on their own sites is really important
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://katelosse.tv'>kate losse</a>:  <blockquote><p>without your analytics you have to track google alerts - squarespace shows me my referrrals directly
<p>I used to have google analytics on tumblr, but they removed a lot of the search terms unless you pay them
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://kevinmarks.com'>Kevin Marks</a>:  <blockquote><p>when Google changed to https default for search the referer links went away - they show some of it to advertisers
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://katelosse.tv'>kate losse</a>:  <blockquote><p>analytics is what has fallen down since 5 years ago - people are slowly adding it back in
<p>medium used to have a lot of information on referrers, and it went down over time
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://kevinmarks.com'>Kevin Marks</a>:  <blockquote><p>some of the loss of referrer info is due to mobile apps not sending them
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://katelosse.tv'>kate losse</a>:  <blockquote><p>if you sign up for ads on twitter they will give you analytics, so they're using it as bait
<p>it's nice to publish at places that pay you, but you don;t always know who has seen it
<p>there is a weight to writing on your own space that has more permanence than posting on medium or facebook
<p>there is something safer about putting writing on your own space first and then sharing it on silos
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://werd.io/'>Ben Werdmüller</a>:  <blockquote><p>you usually assign a license to silos to republish your work
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>the one I have seen is that deviant art has the right to reassign your work to someone else
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://erinjo.is'>Erin Jo Richey</a>:  <blockquote><p><a class="auto-link" href="http://tos-dr.org">tos-dr.org</a> shows the terms of service reduced to icons that explain what rights they are trying to claim from you
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://snarfed.org/'>Ryan Barrett</a>:  <blockquote><p>we have seen more of companies rebalancing their terms of service recently
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://erinjo.is'>Erin Jo Richey</a>:  <blockquote><p>I have done some usability testing where people read the terms of service as part of signing up and object
<p>a lot of the founders had not read the ToS before the user experiment, and they then referred back to lawyers to fix
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://kevinmarks.com'>Kevin Marks</a>:  <blockquote><p>there has been a backlash against facebook messenger asking for more permissions on mobile now
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p> we have hugely upgraded irc logs by <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/aaronpk">@aaronpk</a> <a class="auto-link" href="https://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-08-13">https://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-08-13</a> - faces, sans-serif not monospace and wiki edit faces
<p>these are the nicest IRC logs on the web - I think they're even nicer than <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/slackhq">@slackhq</a>
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/andigalpern'>Andi Galpern</a>:  <blockquote><p>can I suggest css fixes? <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/t">@t</a> <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/aaronpk">@aaronpk</a> posted a link to the github for changes <a class="auto-link" href="https://github.com/aaronpk/indiewebcamp-irc-logs">https://github.com/aaronpk/indiewebcamp-irc-logs</a>
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>I don't add google analytics to my site because I see slowdown on major sites 
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://kevinmarks.com'>Kevin Marks</a>:  <blockquote><p>I remember techcrunch taking 250MB of RAM to load as they kept adding more and more js
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>we used to use <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/techcrunch">@techcrunch</a> as a test page on mozilla for performance because they were such "button sluts" as <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/erinjo">@erinjo</a> says
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://werd.io/'>Ben Werdmüller</a>:  <blockquote><p>analytics is one of the things that people have talked to us about for <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/withknown">@withknown</a> - understanding the audience for their own site
<p>when you're getting webmentions via brid,gy and elsewhere to your <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/withknown">@withknown</a> site there is a huge analytics opportunity
<p>it would be good for <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/indiewebcamp">@indiewebcamp</a> to know what pages people are coming into and finding out about us
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://snarfed.org/'>Ryan Barrett</a>:  <blockquote><p>there is a lot of information that matter more to corporations than individuals, but for writers and photographers too
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/andigalpern'>Andi Galpern</a>:  <blockquote><p>being able to change how you present information, or look at youtube dropoff rates over time is really useful
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://erinjo.is'>Erin Jo Richey</a>:  <blockquote><p>we've talked a lot about data ownership as the first step, but understanding how people use it can be the second step
<p>what people care about, what they find interesting can be part of this flow and connection to the web
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://karaemurphy.com'>Kara Murphy</a>:  <blockquote><p>you want to see where they are coming from too, so you can see what is effective over time
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/andigalpern'>Andi Galpern</a>:  <blockquote><p>I get the same thing for sponsors, they use tracking links to confirm that we sent the info
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://katelosse.tv'>kate losse</a>:  <blockquote><p>you already know some kind of information how people heard, but having that summarized matters
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/andigalpern'>Andi Galpern</a>:  <blockquote><p>there was a TED talk on knowing the data about your own body - and knowing it better than your doctors
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>Aaron has been tracking himself - see <a class="auto-link" href="http://aaronparecki.com/metrics">aaronparecki.com/metrics</a> for what he has found
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://karaemurphy.com'>Kara Murphy</a>:  <blockquote><p>I like this tool by <a class="auto-link" href="http://visual.ly">visual.ly</a> that will make a useful rendition of your google analytics data
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>another general announcement over the last 2 weeks is that the w3c opened up the social web working group covering our topics 
<p>there are companies wanting to work on standards for this - if you're a w3c member join, or apply as an invited expert
<p>the w3c working group is at <a class="auto-link" href="http://w3.org/wiki/socialwg">w3.org/wiki/socialwg</a> and I'm one of the chairs form #indieweb along with <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/evanpro">@evanpro</a> 
<p>I have chosen to use purely IRC and wiki as the social web working group and ignoring the mailing list 
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://kylewm.com'>Kyle Mahan</a>:  <blockquote><p>aaron wrote about how to collect data easily: <a class="auto-link" href="http://aaronparecki.com/articles/2012/10/28/1/low-friction-personal-data-collection">http://aaronparecki.com/articles/2012/10/28/1/low-friction-personal-data-collection</a>
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://karaemurphy.com'>Kara Murphy</a>:  <blockquote><p>I would like a great photo plugin for my personal site (which is on wordpress)
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://katelosse.tv'>kate losse</a>:  <blockquote><p>my next step is to syndicate out to silos - I would like to know how to do that more easily
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://karaemurphy.com'>Kara Murphy</a>:  <blockquote><p>I need to find a good font for my logo too, so it works for cards too
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://kylewm.com'>Kyle Mahan</a>:  <blockquote><p>do you have control of the HTML in Squarespace?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/andigalpern'>Andi Galpern</a>:  <blockquote><p>you have some control in developer mode on squarespace but you have to use !important a lot
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://snarfed.org/'>Ryan Barrett</a>:  <blockquote><p>does squarespace have space for people to comment?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://katelosse.tv'>kate losse</a>:  <blockquote><p>I'm not a big pro-comments person because I'm female and they tend to be "you're a slut"
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/andigalpern'>Andi Galpern</a>:  <blockquote><p>I've heard that a lot from women writing in public - they don't find comments worth the pain 
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://katelosse.tv'>kate losse</a>:  <blockquote><p>I had a post on the New Yorker and they moderate their comments really well so it is less full of hate
<p>I write things on my site that I don't want to take the trouble of pitching an editor about, which can take a month
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://kylewm.com'>Kyle Mahan</a>:  <blockquote><p>I undertook taking jquery out of my site so there are fewer things to download because I wasn't using it much
<p>I've been using barnaby's script to only download what is needed for each page
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://snarfed.org/'>Ryan Barrett</a>:  <blockquote><p>Nick put up a section called bcc on his site where any non-trivial mailing lists mails he sends he puts there too
<p>this is up at <a class="auto-link" href="http://bcc.npdoty.name">bcc.npdoty.name</a> to see his public emails
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>public email list are basically just silos of another sort, so owning our own public posts see <a class="auto-link" href="http://indiewebcamp.com/email_list">http://indiewebcamp.com/email_list</a>
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://snarfed.org/'>Ryan Barrett</a>:  <blockquote><p>another thing we have working in brid,gy is posting a comment on your own site and using webmention
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://katelosse.tv'>kate losse</a>:  <blockquote><p>the drama on twitter is that guys can create accounts all day and post slurs at people; a domain might limit that
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://snarfed.org/'>Ryan Barrett</a>:  <blockquote><p>seeing the reply chain like you do on twitter is not something we have working well on indieweb yet
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://katelosse.tv'>kate losse</a>:  <blockquote><p>twitter is now the easiest place on the web to go and harass people, because it is so easy to create an account
<p>people are making ad hoc twitter tools that adjust who can reply to you when and give you more control
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://werd.io/'>Ben Werdmüller</a>:  <blockquote><p>the nice thing about the indieweb is that everyone gets to make their own algorithm for spam control
<p>harassment is something that we are going to have to deal with, and using your social graph is going to be key
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://kevinmarks.com'>Kevin Marks</a>:  <blockquote><p>Twitter used to prioritize people you follow, now it prioritizes @-replies, gives trolls direct access to your phone
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>we have been talking about this in the channel and made <a class="auto-link" href="http://indiewebcamp.com/block">indiewebcamp.com/block</a> and <a class="auto-link" href="http://indiewebcamp.com/mute">indiewebcamp.com/mute</a>
<p>I got some mundane things working on my site that I documented on the PHP page
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://werd.io/'>Ben Werdmüller</a>:  <blockquote><p>the indieweb PHP webmention client uses deprecated php features so it throws massive errors
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>I started POSSEing directly to facebook using <a class="auto-link" href="http://brid.gy">brid.gy</a> publish rather than going via twitter, and got more interaction
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://snarfed.org/'>Ryan Barrett</a>:  <blockquote><p>do everything manually until it hurts - then change it
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://werd.io/'>Ben Werdmüller</a>:  <blockquote><p>we have themes now on known and I built a new one on my site <a class="auto-link" href="http://werd.io">werd.io</a>
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://erinjo.is'>Erin Jo Richey</a>:  <blockquote><p>we keep hearing that nobody wants to have their own websites, but educators keep asking for it for their students
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://kevinmarks.com'>Kevin Marks</a>:  <blockquote><p>my son <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/andrewjohnmarks">@andrewjohnmarks</a> has an indieweb site now: http://www.andrewmarks.media/profile/andrewmarks
<p>Andrew also made an indieweb comment on my site <a class="auto-link" href="http://kevinmarks.com">kevinmarks.com</a> "nice website noob"
