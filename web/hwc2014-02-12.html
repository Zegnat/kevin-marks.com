<p><a class='h-card' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com'>Kevin Marks</a>:  <blockquote><p>getting ready for Homebrew Website Club - our video link is too hard to configure
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>we should spend our time talking rather than doing IT
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href=''>Brian</a>:  <blockquote><p>I'm Brian, I worked for USGS, got bored. now I'm building my own site, because making HTML from FORTRAN got old
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://jonathan.is'>Jonathan Dahan</a>:  <blockquote><p>I work at the Museum of Art, and I have an image for every object in the collection
<p>I found it easier to scrape our own website to get the images than to work on internal politics
<p>I have a little box called "Occupy Here" which creates a local network to upload and share
<p>Occupy Here will connect to an uplink if there is one, if not it works locally as a host
<p>Alan Kay started a new research lab with Vi Hart and some other interesting people
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href=''>Brian</a>:  <blockquote><p>there was a Stanford vis group site based on census data that you could visualize. I want to do this with seismic data
<p>Maps are what I'm most interested in; I want very specific comments with permalinks
<p>After an earthquake the USGS updates the event
<p>there a projects looking at getting reports form twitter- I'd like to mesh them all together
<p>I'm just glad to not be using FORTRAN
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://twitter.com/schnarfed'>Ryan Barrett</a>:  <blockquote><p>I run a service called brid,gy  check it out. I switched my personal site to SSL for everyone
<p>mainly people who use privacy tools are a minority. We should make encryption the default
<p>
<p>the more people using SSL, the less suspicious it is by default
<p>for whatever stack you use, there is a write-up. You can get free certs for open source projects
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>there are good write-ups on the indiewebcamp wiki for Apache and nginx for SSL
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://twitter.com/schnarfed'>Ryan Barrett</a>:  <blockquote><p>turning on SSL is an hour to  a half day of work, but it's a break from coding
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.metamage.com/'>Josh Juran</a>:  <blockquote><p>I am intrigued by everything being a file, and how far I could push that
<p>FreeMount https://github.com/jjuran/freemount is my codebase for distributing apps in file-based way
<p>the bytecode I have selected is the Motorola 68K machine [sounds like QTOS - @peterkinoma]

<a class='h-card' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>I'd like to bring up webmentions of homepages
<p>webmention is simplified pingback where you can tell if there is  post, a reply, an RSVP etc. 
<p>webmentions have mostly been used for permalink to permalink, but we do mention people by name
<p>on Twitter and Facebook you have mentions pages for when people refer to you
<p>Invitations are interesting for this too - you can webmention their homepage to invite them
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com'>Kevin Marks</a>:  <blockquote><p>inviting people to a chatroom - mentioning them so they come to a place. would a webmention work?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://twitter.com/schnarfed'>Ryan Barrett</a>:  <blockquote><p>would a webmention per message work, or is this for inviting them into a conversation?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://benwerd.com/'>Ben Werdmüller</a>:  <blockquote><p>webmention may be a bit heavyweight - it would work for starting a conversation
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>@aaronpk has built a model for keeping conversations live over websockets using replies
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://jonathan.is'>Jonathan Dahan</a>:  <blockquote><p>webmentions work as conversations between client and host? 2 hosts are involved
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://twitter.com/schnarfed'>Ryan Barrett</a>:  <blockquote><p>using webmention for email-like conversations could work, with address by url not email
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://benwerd.com/'>Ben Werdmüller</a>:  <blockquote><p>what we're looking at with idno is that there are keys embedded in the page that can be used to sign
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>on the receiving side, none of us know what to do with homepage mentions 
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://benwerd.com/'>Ben Werdmüller</a>:  <blockquote><p>I have the backend for homepage mentions, but not the frontpage yet Sochi is keeping me busy
<p></blockquote>

<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>the problem with search engines is they have secret sauce and we don't know how it got there.
<p>I've seen images show up from indieweb pages that are form other pages entirely
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://jonathan.is'>Jonathan Dahan</a>:  <blockquote><p>you can't run the silo's crawlers is the problem - adding Twitter cards to the Gallery is tricky
<p>If you use a CDN, the tools don't always reflect your site well
<p>we now have a lot of redundant data on our site fro twitter, facebook and google
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href=''>Brian</a>:  <blockquote><p>how do you extend microformats? What if I want geopoints? - you can use gel lat long, structured address.
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>if we don't know how to do something, we look at published examples in the wold
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com'>Kevin Marks</a>:  <blockquote><p>a point with #microformats is that they are composable - you can add new elements
