<p>what if Siri responded with a ranked list of apps for a query? [sounds like @DoAT to me]
<p>I recently switched to Android, and I think Google Now is a pretty great product - google should offer that to developers

<p>Tounderstand heart, watch Jiro Dreams of Sushi - get it on your netflix now [there's no Netflix in France, is there?]
<p>70% of businesses with a formal exit or IPO did not start with a business plan - heart driven wins out #tummel

<a class='h-card' href='http://web-strategist.com/blog'>Jeremiah Owyang</a>:  <blockquote><p>six months ago I was talking about the collaborative economy, and asking if big companies could be part of this
<p>The last 10 years have been democratising media - 10 years ago Le Web was Les Blogs
<p>the tools we used to use to publish media are now being used to build products in the physical world
<p>we're going to see the democratisation of the physical world in the next 10 years
<p>big trends: 3D printing; high funded sharing economy; Crowdfunding and Bitcoin
<p>Corporations are making the crowd part of their company: eg GE working with Quirky
<p>U-Haul sells U-Notes in increments of $100 to create a shared fate - the highest form of loyalty
<p>A company called Custom Made make high end matching jewelry to match the Lincoln car
<p>Ask Executives what the purpose of business is, Profit is the biggest. Millennials say Societal Development, Innovation
<p>Toms shoes launched a marketplace selling artisans' social good products
<p>Nokia released 3D printable files to enable custom cases to be made
<p>I'm starting a new company called crowdcompanies.com as a Brand Counceil for large companies who want to Collaborate
<p>The bog corporations pay, the startups don't
<p>people can make physical goods and share them instead fo buying anew
<p>Corporations that partner with these empowered people can become resilient

<p>you founded about.me, sold it to AOL, and then you bought it back. Tempting fate?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://about.me/tonyconrad'>Tony Conrad</a>:  <blockquote><p>I realised at AOL that there weren't as many integration opportunities as we had thought - they were more media
<p>we decided to focus on engagement rather than growth
<p>you shouldn't be defined by algorithms or your professional experience, but how you see yourself [a fake #indieweb?]
<p> I start to see 19-year old college kids use about.me as a resume to get internships
<p>these pages can create value for you even if you don't go back to the product -linkedin and about.me are like that
<p>you are curious about who is curious about you, so we tell you who put you in categories or viewed your page
<p>we are seeing a lot of party round financing, which can give the illusion of progress - do you have an anchor [VC FUD?]

<a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@sippey'>Michael Sippey</a>:  <blockquote><p>twitter has its roots in mobile - it started out in text messaging and became web later
<p>at twitter we were very early in the app store for iOS and Android [er, not earlier than 3rd parties]
<p>we made the first big change to the home timeline in a long time, by making it easier to follow conversations [blue lines]
<p>you'll now see photos and video in the timeline now @loic: from instagram? @sippey: no, ask them why
<p>We've taken mobile development and distributed throughout the company - a team developing photos has iOS+Android engs too
<p>we've built an experimentation framework into iOS and Android apps so we can run % experiments on mobile too
<p>we use the data to influence the decision, but not to define it
<p>we met Vine: classic team of a designer, a product manager and an engineer - @loic: you really need a designer now
<p>Vine was the first app that din't have a record button or a play button - you just tap and hold @loic: snapchat does too
<p>Vine have a lot of autonomy and independence -they have a separate office in NYC
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.loiclemeur.com'>Loic Le Meur</a>:  <blockquote><p>why not a separate photo app too?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@sippey'>Michael Sippey</a>:  <blockquote><p>twitter incorporated photos into the core twitter app experience before i joined
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.loiclemeur.com'>Loic Le Meur</a>:  <blockquote><p>how do you see snapchat and ephemeral content?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@sippey'>Michael Sippey</a>:  <blockquote><p>I think snapchat found something interesting - using photos and videos to briefly communicate
<p>we're looking at how we solve the users problems
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.loiclemeur.com'>Loic Le Meur</a>:  <blockquote><p>so you're building a Snapchat competitor?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@sippey'>Michael Sippey</a>:  <blockquote><p>No we're not.
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.loiclemeur.com'>Loic Le Meur</a>:  <blockquote><p>how about you post a tweet and it disappears? [could write that with the API - auto-delete]
<p>I have an 18 year old in college who sends me things on SnapChat that are disturbing
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@sippey'>Michael Sippey</a>:  <blockquote><p>we have a lot of users in school or college who use twitter for public communication among their peers
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.loiclemeur.com'>Loic Le Meur</a>:  <blockquote><p>how do you see Facebook versus twitter - they seem to be one by one taking your features?
<p>have you read @nickbilton's book Hatching Twitter? I highly recommend it
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@sippey'>Michael Sippey</a>:  <blockquote><p>what our users tell us that they love about twitter is that it is live, public conversational and distributed everywhere

<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@sippey'>Michael Sippey</a>:  <blockquote><p>Facebook has their product, I'm focused on twitter - not looking at them but at us
<p>I joined sixapart in 2004 -we were all blogging then, The shift has been to mobile and cloud enabling small teams
<p>in 10 years the devices we carry will have better sensors and tools to share content and context from wherever we are
<p>you can tell we're old as we both have watches my watch is a heads up display for time and date-
<p>last year @KatieS was here at Le Web - she's building up international here at a great rate

<p>if you think twitter hasn't changed much then we're doing our job - it feels familiar but it develops well
<p>the IPO hasn't really changed the company - we've been focused on a sustainable business and executing well
<p>the market invests in the future of the company, and we're building that future

<a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@nickdaloisio'>Nick D'Aloisio</a>:  <blockquote><p>the reason I built summly was because of all the time i spent going back and forth between results and apges
<p>the summly algorithm is used in the Yahoo App in the US app store
<p>I'm full time at Yahoo, but I'm finishing my A-Levels at school too
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.loiclemeur.com'>Loic Le Meur</a>:  <blockquote><p>So, you sold summly for $30 million?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@nickdaloisio'>Nick D'Aloisio</a>:  <blockquote><p>I can't say. No really, I can't tell you.
<p>yahoo has huge corpora - so much information. Making that personal could be really interesting
<p>a lot of the time wasted on mobile is people faffing about trying to find what they want
<p>if you have a conversation you forget half of it in an hour. Permanancy isn't natural for humans. Snapchat does that
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.loiclemeur.com'>Loic Le Meur</a>:  <blockquote><p>so our conversation is transient, unless you're like @scobleizer. Fortunately we're not all like Scoble
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@nickdaloisio'>Nick D'Aloisio</a>:  <blockquote><p>there is a value for permancy, as long as I want it to be. I don't necessarily want it read back to me in 5 years
<p>people take screenshots of private chat conversations in Facebook etc and post them. They want to avoid that
<p>I'm fascinated by self-learning - making accessibility if knowledge really easy and fun is what I care about
<p>even though I had IT lessons at school, there was no idea of starting a company instead of joining one. teach that too
<p>making entrepreneurship as an option available for schools around the world is key
<p>I think Bitcoin is interesting, but I don't know much about it. I like the decentralisation
<p>when I was doing summly it was great to have Angels to lean on when it went badly. Crowdsourced doesn't do that
<p>It's important to raise external capital because it keeps you in check - you need external people to keep you in line

<p>pre 1863 in the US there were 8000 entities printing their own money - it was unwieldy and prone to forgery
<p>the gold standard was invented in 1821 by Britain, and the US went off it in 1971
<p>in 2002 QQ's q-coins were used outside QQ.com - the chinese govt banned this in 2007
<p>2009-2012 Facebook credits came out, but despite their ability to fore peoepl to use it, it still died out
<p>No-one owns bitcoin -the founders found a way to disappear [except they have the bulk of holdings]
<p>anonymity of BitCoin has had a lot of press, but the 3 big drugs and guns marketplaces have been shut down this year
<p>in 2013 Bernanke said that the US wasn't interested in regiulating virtual currencies 
<p>People's Bank of China recently said that companies and banks should not accept them, though individuals could
<p>You can only spend bitcoin in about 1000 places worldwide
<p>up until a few weeks ago, 65% of bitcoin trading was in china. That may change now the Bank of China has spoken
<p>there are about 60 other digital currencies that have copied this idea

<a class='h-card' href='http://www.garrickhileman.com'>Garrick Hileman</a>:  <blockquote><p>Technology folks are excited about crypto and exotic hardware. Governments are excited too
<p>Governments worry about the money laundering aspects of bitcoin, but care about the growth potential
<p>VC's are excited about bitcoin because they see it as disrupting the multi-billion payments industry

<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.garrickhileman.com'>Garrick Hileman</a>:  <blockquote><p>China's stance on Bitcoin was not as strong as on QQ, because it is not centralised and harder to regulate
<p>the most common cause of death of alternative currencies is technical advance or lack of demand
<p>we can see that Bitcoin has problems in the 10 minutes it takes to update the blockchain
<p>Satoshi retained enough bitcoins to be a billionaire, the litecoin founder deliberately has not.

<a class='h-card' href='http://www.linkedin.com/in/shakilkhan'>Shakil Khan</a>:  <blockquote><p>look at the gap between what understanding we have and the mainstream

<p><a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@dinakaplan'>Dina Kaplan</a>:  <blockquote><p>I say this not to sound boastful or American, if those are really two different things, but because I was full of fear.
<p>I realise now that I was afraid to ask for help- that people would think I was not capable
<p>I had no women role models to look up to, so I had to emulate men. I suppressed every single emotion that I felt
<p>I felt like an actress playing the role of an entrepreneur. This was imposter syndrome.
<p>I was afraid that I'd collapse when crossing the street in New York. I quit my job + booked a 1 way ticket to Indonesia
<p>After trevelling the world, collecting countries for the facebook photos, I took a ten day meditation retreat.
<p>I realised that I had only wanted to be liked.

<a class='h-card' href='http://blog.elatable.com'>Bradley Horowitz</a>:  <blockquote><p>as well as self-driving cars and Glass, other moonshots are Chrome and Android - which now seem obvious
<p>We're not afraid at google of doing things that are technologically significant and take a while
<p>we don't just backup and upload your photos, we use the compute power of Google to smooth wrinkles on people's faces
<p>Plus Post Ads promote brands google plus posts out to the rest of the web.
<p>we've introduced a new google ad format which is a G+ post that users can comment on and engage with elsewhere on the web
<p>YouTube now uses Google+ for commenting, so you can go to a billion view video like Gangnam style and see friends comments
<p>we had a lot of problems with ranking of g+ comments on YouTube, but we have made changes to make them better
<p>Google Plus has never been about Facebook - it solves a very different use case as it is private
<p>Google Hangouts taps into the same use case as Snapchat - its ephemeral and easy and has recording protections
<p>YouTube integration, Google Drive and all the other G+ integrations were part of the plan, and there will be more
<p>we have a lot of apis and services available for developers to work with, it's not just about us buying companies
<p>you don't want to optimise your company to be bought by google, build a great company and it's a side effect

<p>China is a parallel universe - when it comes to tech. China has 8 million college graduates a year vs 3 million in the US
<p>600 million internet users in China - 500 million smartphone users that has doubled in 6 months
<p>there is not one Western app in the top ten of apps in China, QQ has 5 of them QQ 600m users
<p>Taobao - is more than twice ebay and amazon combined - you can buy anything on Taobao
<p>China's Singles Day is like the opposite of Valentines Day - you celebrate by buying things for yourself online
<p>Singles Day was $5.7B = over $1B from phones.

<p>Alipay is about 1/3 of all chinese payments $1000B vs $180B for paypal

<p>The Arduino happened almost by accident- it was designed by an italian professor for his students, open sourced and spread
<p>I run Highway1 because I believe that hardware is the future - we take startups to china to learn to manufacture
<p>our first incubated compay, birdi, launched on indiegogo today: http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/birdi
<p>hardware prototyping can be done easily now, raising dollars on kickstarter can be done, but shipping thousands is a dark art
<p>Scale requires rigor - you need partners in Huaqiangbei - hardware flows like software
<p>Bunny Hwang's http://circuitstickers.com/ was built on a field trip to china
<p>Manufacturing informs your product- you can't just hit go on the 3D printer and have it work in the factory
<p>Software matters - its what makes the product make sense and makes your users love you.
<p>We're going to be inundated with connected gadgets that don't talk to each other. We need an OS for IoT
<p>Big box retailers need to be made startup friendly - they currently demand too much inventory

<p>there is a new 3D printer launched every week on kickstarter, and they're big enough to print shoes
<p>any thermoplastic can be put into a 3D printer, which means many different possible materials for shoes
<p>unlike a cellphone, you have to make sizes for shoes - 3D printing makes this easier
<p>We don't sell printers, we sell shoes as they have more margin and more speed for fashion 
<p>it takes several hours to print a shoe, but we can just get more machines, and we can still turnround in a  day
<p>you can see the printer not making solid shoes but a subtle honeycombed interior space
<p>we optimize the machine path file for a specific design, making it smoother and 25% faster
<p>we can make different designs from a basic ballet flat by using images as bump maps to emboss them
<p>we're going to make ready-to-wear 3D printed shoes, not just for the runway
<p>we need slightly bigger printers for mens shoes, @brady
