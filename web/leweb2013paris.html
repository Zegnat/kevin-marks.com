<p>what if Siri responded with a ranked list of apps for a query? [sounds like @DoAT to me]
<p>I recently switched to Android, and I think Google Now is a pretty great product - google should offer that to developers

<a class='h-card' href='http://web-strategist.com/blog'>Jeremiah Owyang</a>:  <blockquote><p>six months ago I was talking about the collaborative economy, and asking if big companies could be part of this
<p>The last 10 years have been democratising media - 10 years ago Le Web was Les Blogs
<p>the tools we used to use to publish media are now being used to build products in the physical world
<p>we're going to see the democratisation of the physical world in the next 10 years
<p>big trends: 3D printing; high funded sharing economy; Crowdfunding and Bitcoin
<p>Corporations are making the crowd part of their company: eg GE working with Quirky
<p>U-Haul sells U-Notes in increments of $100 to create a shared fate - the highest form of loyalty
<p>A company called Custom Made make high end matching jewelry to match the Lincoln car
<p>Ask Executives what the purpose of business is, Profit is the biggest. Millennials say Societal Development, Innovation
<p>Toms shoes launched a marketplace selling artisans' social good products
<p>Nokia released 3D printable files to enable custom cases to be made
<p>I'm starting a new company called crowdcompanies.com as a Brand Counceil for large companies who want to Collaborate
<p>The bog corporations pay, the startups don't
<p>people can make physical goods and share them instead fo buying anew
<p>Corporations that partner with these empowered people can become resilient

<a class='h-card' href='http://om.co'>Om Malik</a>:  <blockquote><p>Tony and I are old friends and partners at the VC fund True Ventures
<p>you founded about.me, sold it to AOL, and then you bought it back. Tempting fate?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://about.me/tonyconrad'>Tony Conrad</a>:  <blockquote><p>I realised at AOL that there weren't as many integration opportunities as we had thought - they were more media
<p>we decided to focus on engagement rather than growth
<p>you shouldn't be defined by algorithms or your professional experience, but how you see yourself [a fake #indieweb?]
<p> I start to see 19-year old college kids use about.me as a resume to get internships
<p>these pages can create value for you even if you don't go back to the product -linkedin and about.me are like that
<p>you are curious about who is curious about you, so we tell you who put you in categories or viewed your page
<p>we are seeing a lot of party round financing, which can give the illusion of progress - do you have an anchor [VC FUD?]
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://om.co'>Om Malik</a>:  <blockquote><p>there isn't enough time in the day to go through each pitch and each company. How do you rise above the crowd?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://about.me/tonyconrad'>Tony Conrad</a>:  <blockquote><p>if you're becoming a founder you need to think of a 35 year career - cultivating relationships
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://om.co'>Om Malik</a>:  <blockquote><p>startups aren't fighting the battle for money, you're fighting for talent and attention. Without those you won't succeed
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://about.me/tonyconrad'>Tony Conrad</a>:  <blockquote><p>startup founders now as opposed to ten years ago are so much more knowledgeable
<p>Matt Mullenweg was betting on us to be good stewards. Today he'd be plugged in to so much more
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://om.co'>Om Malik</a>:  <blockquote><p>Startup founders are so much more informed, but are they more knowledgeable? How do they break out?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://about.me/tonyconrad'>Tony Conrad</a>:  <blockquote><p>in the next 10 years startup activity is going to go off the hook - we just invested in a submarine robotics company!
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://om.co'>Om Malik</a>:  <blockquote><p>I wantto thank @loic and @geraldine for making Le Web the most important conference in Europe
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@sippey'>Michael Sippey</a>:  <blockquote><p>twitter has its roots in mobile - it started out in text messaging and became web later
<p>at twitter we were very early in the app store for iOS and Android [er, not earlier than 3rd parties]
<p>we made the first big change to the home timeline in a long time, by making it easier to follow conversations [blue lines]
<p>you'll now see photos and video in the timeline now @loic: from instagram? @sippey: no, ask them why
<p>We've taken mobile development and distributed throughout the company - a team developing photos has iOS+Android engs too
<p>we've built an experimentation framework into iOS and Android apps so we can run % experiments on mobile too
<p>we use the data to influence the decision, but not to define it
<p>we met Vine: classic team of a designer, a product manager and an engineer - @loic: you really need a designer now
<p>Vine was the first app that din't have a record button or a play button - you just tap and hold @loic: snapchat does too
<p>Vine have a lot of autonomy and independence -they have a separate office in NYC
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.loiclemeur.com'>Loic Le Meur</a>:  <blockquote><p>why not a separate photo app too?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@sippey'>Michael Sippey</a>:  <blockquote><p>twitter incorporated photos into the core twitter app experience before i joined
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.loiclemeur.com'>Loic Le Meur</a>:  <blockquote><p>how do you see snapchat and ephemeral content?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@sippey'>Michael Sippey</a>:  <blockquote><p>I think snapchat found something interesting - using photos and videos to briefly communicate
<p>we're looking at how we solve the users problems
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.loiclemeur.com'>Loic Le Meur</a>:  <blockquote><p>so you're building a Snapchat competitor?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@sippey'>Michael Sippey</a>:  <blockquote><p>No we're not.
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.loiclemeur.com'>Loic Le Meur</a>:  <blockquote><p>how about you post a tweet and it disappears? [could write that with the API - auto-delete]
<p>I have an 18 year old in college who sends me things on SnapChat that are disturbing
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@sippey'>Michael Sippey</a>:  <blockquote><p>we have a lot of users in school or college who use twitter for public communication among their peers
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.loiclemeur.com'>Loic Le Meur</a>:  <blockquote><p>how do you see Facebook versus twitter - they seem to be one by one taking your features?
<p>have you read @nickbilton's book Hatching Twitter? I highly recommend it
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@sippey'>Michael Sippey</a>:  <blockquote><p>what our users tell us that they love about twitter is that it is live, public conversational and distributed everywhere
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.loiclemeur.com'>Loic Le Meur</a>:  <blockquote><p>I can't follow whats happeneing around Le Web on facebook, only twitter
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@sippey'>Michael Sippey</a>:  <blockquote><p>we've done a lot of work on search, and integration with television - putting on air and sending back
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.loiclemeur.com'>Loic Le Meur</a>:  <blockquote><p>Facebook have a feed, but their search sucks
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@sippey'>Michael Sippey</a>:  <blockquote><p>Facebook has their product, I'm focused on twitter - not looking at them but at us
<p>I joined sixapart in 2004 -we were all blogging then, The shift has been to mobile and cloud enabling small teams
<p>in 10 years the devices we carry will have better sensors and tools to share content and context from wherever we are
<p>you can tell we're old as we both have watches my watch is a heads up display for time and date-
<p>last year @KatieS was here at Le Web - she's building up international here at a great rate
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.loiclemeur.com'>Loic Le Meur</a>:  <blockquote><p>politicians in France talk amongst each other - thats amazing to me
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@sippey'>Michael Sippey</a>:  <blockquote><p>usernames will stay, but we hear from new users that @ handles and hashtags are confusing so we need to help
<p>if you think twitter hasn't changed much then we're doing our job - it feels familiar but it develops well
<p>the IPO hasn't really changed the company - we've been focused on a sustainable business and executing well
<p>the market invests in the future of the company, and we're building that future

<a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@nickdaloisio'>Nick D'Aloisio</a>:  <blockquote><p>the reason I built summly was because of all the time i spent going back and forth between results and apges
<p>the summly algorithm is used in the Yahoo App in the US app store
<p>I'm full time at Yahoo, but I'm finishing my A-Levels at school too
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.loiclemeur.com'>Loic Le Meur</a>:  <blockquote><p>So, you sold summly for $30 million?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@nickdaloisio'>Nick D'Aloisio</a>:  <blockquote><p>I can't say. No really, I can't tell you.
<p>yahoo has huge corpora - so much information. Making that personal could be really interesting
<p>a lot of the time wasted on mobile is people faffing about trying to find what they want
<p>if you have a conversation you forget half of it in an hour. Permanancy isn't natural for humans. Snapchat does that
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.loiclemeur.com'>Loic Le Meur</a>:  <blockquote><p>so our conversation is transient, unless you're like @scobleizer. Fortunately we're not all like Scoble
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@nickdaloisio'>Nick D'Aloisio</a>:  <blockquote><p>there is a value for permancy, as long as I want it to be. I don't necessarily want it read back to me in 5 years
<p>people take screenshots of private chat conversations in Facebook etc and post them. They want to avoid that
<p>I'm fascinated by self-learning - making accessibility if knowledge really easy and fun is what I care about
<p>even though I had IT lessons at school, there was no idea of starting a company instead of joining one. teach that too
<p>making entrepreneurship as an option available for schools around the world is key
<p>I think Bitcoin is interesting, but I don't know much about it. I like the decentralisation
<p>when I was doing summly it was great to have Angels to lean on when it went badly. Crowdsourced doesn't do that
<p>It's important to raise external capital because it keeps you in check - you need external people to keep you in line
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.loiclemeur.com'>Loic Le Meur</a>:  <blockquote><p>you can tell this bitcoin video is old as it says they're worth $70 each

<a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@JamesCurrier'>JamesCurrier</a>:  <blockquote><p>3000 years ago, people used gold and sliver both for storage of value and exchange of value
<p>pre 1863 in the US there were 8000 entities printing their own money - it was unwieldy and prone to forgery
<p>the gold standard was invented in 1821 by Britain, and the US went off it in 1971
<p>in 2002 QQ's q-coins were used outside QQ.com - the chinese govt banned this in 2007
<p>2009-2012 Facebook credits came out, but despite their ability to fore peoepl to use it, it still died out
<p>No-one owns bitcoin -the founders found a way to disappear [except they have the bulk of holdings]
<p>anonymity of BitCoin has had a lot of press, but the 3 big drugs and guns marketplaces have been shut down this year
<p>in 2013 Bernanke said that the US wasn't interested in regiulating virtual currencies 
<p>People's Bank of China recently said that companies and banks should not accept them, though individuals could
<p>You can only spend bitcoin in about 1000 places worldwide
<p>up until a few weeks ago, 65% of bitcoin trading was in china. That may change now the Bank of China has spoken
<p>there are about 60 other digital currencies that have copied this idea

<a class='h-card' href='http://www.garrickhileman.com'>Garrick Hileman</a>:  <blockquote><p>Technology folks are excited about crypto and exotic hardware. Governments are excited too
<p>Governments worry about the money laundering aspects of bitcoin, but care about the growth potential
<p>VC's are excited about bitcoin because they see it as disrupting the multi-billion payments industry

<a class='h-card' href='http://www.linkedin.com/in/shakilkhan'>Shakil Khan</a>:  <blockquote><p>the Western Union remittance model has fees of about 20% on $100 right now to send money internationally now
<p>international trade now hits merchants with huge transaction fees and exchange fees - that is billions too
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.garrickhileman.com'>Garrick Hileman</a>:  <blockquote><p>think of Argentina or another country with a weak domestic currency. Cyprus crisis showed this as Bitcoin went up
<p>At the moment Bitcoin is mostly a store of value, not a transaction currency.
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.linkedin.com/in/shakilkhan'>Shakil Khan</a>:  <blockquote><p>we need more mainstream adoption - we need someone like Amazon, not just @eff and wordpress
<p>will a CFO of a pubicly listed company want that risk?

<p>Bitcoin is not much different than people using tap to pay to pay for their coffee
<p>Merrill Lynch published a large report about Bitcoin last week, we're seeing lots of finance industry interest
<p>lot of retailers like Walmart and UK high street chains are seriously looking into Bitcoin
<p></blockquote>

<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.linkedin.com/in/shakilkhan'>Shakil Khan</a>:  <blockquote><p>"anyone with significant wealth should put 1% into bitcoin" - danger is not understanding it
<p>what really worries me going forward is people putting money into bitcoin to speculate in it
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.garrickhileman.com'>Garrick Hileman</a>:  <blockquote><p>China's stance on Bitcoin was not as strong as on QQ, because it is not centralised and harder to regulate
<p>the most common cause of death of alternative currencies is technical advance or lack of demand
<p>we can see that Bitcoin has problems in the 10 minutes it takes to update the blockchain
<p>Satoshi retained enough bitcoins to be a billionaire, the litecoin founder deliberately has not.
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.linkedin.com/in/shakilkhan'>Shakil Khan</a>:  <blockquote><p>look at the gap between what understanding we have and the mainstream
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.garrickhileman.com'>Garrick Hileman</a>:  <blockquote><p>Money is an abstract thing to begin with. Bitcoin has no actual coins and bills
<p>ultimately all currencies are backed by supply and demand - look at Zimbabwe losing it's currency
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.linkedin.com/in/shakilkhan'>Shakil Khan</a>:  <blockquote><p>Governments can be allies and enemies, purely from lack of understanding. Financial systems are already broken

<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.garrickhileman.com'>Garrick Hileman</a>:  <blockquote><p>prior to the explosion in cryptocurrencies there were 4000 alternative currencies around the world. It's hard to do

<p>what is also required apart from the techincal solution is the consumer trust and branding that they need
<p>the people we hear about losing bitcoins is usually not the protocol but someone running a 'bank' designed to steal them
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.garrickhileman.com'>Garrick Hileman</a>:  <blockquote><p>we don't know what the price of bitcoin is now. Coindesk's price info is valuable here
