<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.nickhanauer.com'>Nick Hanauer</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>we are trying to change the frame of the debate around civic policy nationally
<p>the $15 minimum wage sounded crazy and outlandish when we started talking about it
<p>Seattle now pays tipped workers 500% more than the federal minimum, and now has the best restaurants bar SF
<p>when you pay restaurant workers well enough to eat in restaurants, the whole economy improves
<p>I grew up in a family business  that felt we had a social responsibility to the community

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.blackgirlscode.com/'>Kimberley Bryant</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>if you teach one girl, she will naturally turn around and teach 5,6 or 10 more
<p>we started Black Girls Code in a basement with a few people, only one of whom could code
<p>when I looked in the rooms of conferences and meetup events, I didn't see anyone who looked like me
<p>when we brought the girls in they were inspired by the design thinking and brought their friends and parents
<p>our programme grew from the basement into an international organisation with 10 in the US, 1 in South Africa
<p>I found 45 places from Sydney Australia to a small town in Alabama who were looking for opportunites
<p>African American women achieve only 3% of CS degrees; Latinas 1%, Native Americans <1%
<p>more than 45% of African American Girls are not graduating from high school at all, and graduate slowest
<p>one fo the things that we found was that the girls brought their moms to classrooms too
<p>the training became exponential as the girls trained their peers and mothers to code as well
<p>Rebecca only came to our class because her father made her, but she flourished and excelled
<p>Ida was on a school computer and told the teacher she was showing girls how to make a website
<p>the teacher then set Ida up with an after school programme at her school to teach the girls
<p>what I see when I look at these examples is that girls are natural change agents
<p>I believe the work we are doing with Black Girls code is more than coding - it changes perception too
<p>Girls of colour receive greater punitive and zero tolerance policies, and end in the school to prison pipeline
<p>we need only turn on our TV to see a 250lb officer sitting on a black girl at a pool party
<p>images showing black girls coding, building robots challenge the media portrayal of black girls
<p>I started as a mom who was interested in technology
<p>my job as a mom and as the founder of Black Girls Code is to not let these girls fail
<p> a girl wore her "black girls code" shirt to school. Teacher: "why black girls?" 'Because black girls matter'

<p>the other half is  knowledge work like content marketing, graphic design, anything that can be done remotely
<p>we do about $1B/year in 80 different categories
<p>one of the most recnt developments is that many of the fortune 500 companies are starting to use this
<p>our biggest client has more than 10,000 freelancers working for them

<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.upwork.com'>Stephane Kasriel</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>if you look at frictions in the labour market today, 1% of global GDP is lost to supply/demand mismatch
<p>what are the main sources of inefficiency in labour: location is one- we have great engineers in Louisiana
<p>the jobs are over-concentrated in cites that are too expensive to live in
<p>the next thing is trust - hiring is about trust, I need to know the employee is trustworthy
<p>as the duration of jobs keeps going down, trust becomes more and more important
<p>we provide a reputation system that helps build trust quickly for short term work
<p>the 3rd thing is matching jobs with workers
<p>one of the most complex parts is matching as quickly as possible - hiring takes 4 weeks; we manage in 2 days
<p>who is qualified? who will be interested? are they available now?
<p>how do you try to direct the flow to get the optimum match between open jobs and available free lancers
<p>we want to reduce the amount of time people spend writing job descriptions and long cover letters
<p>the overarching story is that the resume is dead. The half life of a skill is trending down
<p>what is it that you know and what are you interested in doing are key
<p>an established freelancer who has done hundreds, thousands of hours on a platform we don't need to assess
<p>for an established freelancer I can tell them what they are good at - which PHP frameworks etc
<p>clients tend to hire people with lots of feedback; we need to nudge them to consider new people
<p>you need to get a nanojob and a nanodegree and a few more nanodegrees and jobs

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@zeynepton'>Zeynep Ton</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I'm goign to talk about how to make low wage jobs better jobs without urting prices or profits
<p>in 1913 Ford lowered the cost of production os the average americn could buy a car
<p>but this system had a weakness - ebveryone was interchangeable parts
<p>then Toyota by design created a human centred system empowering the employees to fix problems
<p>Toyota showed the world that the outcome was higher productivity and better quality too
<p>toyota became the gold standard and everyone copied them
<p>Todat's mass production workers don't work in factories but in retail and food service
<p>if you want to make an economy inclusive you ahve to make these jobs better jobs
<p>I'm an operations managment professor and I started looking at retail supply chains to optimise inventory
<p>we saw retail did a good job at planning but broke down at teh store level
<p>we found goods were stuck in stores and retail tells were inaccurate
<p>we found so many stores had operational problems with  low staff and high staff turnover
<p>what i saw was that retail was operating in a vicious cycle where labour was treated as as cost to minimise
<p>then retailer underinvest in workers in wages, in training and in staffing
<p>this vicious cycle is bad for the cutomers and the companies as well as the workers
<p>Next i staretd working for companies that worked in excellence like mercadona in spain
<p>mercadona's employee turnover is 3.8% - I coudln't believe this was so low
<p>they provide training, schedules are known one month in advance and staff are happy
<p>I ten mmoved to Alabama QuikTrip a chain wiht gasoline and convenience stores
<p>QuikTrip has been in fortunes 100 best companies to work fro for years in a row
<p>what si their secret? How do they get low prices, good jobs and great performance
<p>I wanted it to be higher wages and benefits simply creating higher performance
<p>what I found was that they were like Toyota the achieved excellence through human centred Opeating system
<p>often you see people in retail whose only job is shelving merchandise
<p>in mercadona they will shelve, order products, and open a till if needed - they are empowered to improve
<p>they chose to give some slack in the system so employees can do more things
<p>mercadona have only around 8000 prodcuts not the 40000 of a typical store
<p>thsi system is better for employees and drives operational excellence too
<p>for these to work, you need a qualified workforce, so they invest in people
<p>right now there are too few operating  Good Job Strategy - that si a way fro companies to compete better
<p>this is not easy to pull off - excellence is harder to achieve than mediocrity
<p>Worker groups: put pressure on companies that have a good jobs strategy
<p>investors: ask companies for data on employee turnover, engagement and activism so they measure them
<p>Patty Donovan of QuikTrip said "I work with 12-14 people, and they touch others so they can be happy and succesful"

<p>we started out outsourcing to other companies, but realised if we wanted the best employees, be the best emplotr
<p>we implemented what Zeynep said in her book - cross-training is key
<p>We had a handyman at IKEA in our uniform who created referrals by good behaviour
<p>supply side referrals is the hardest part of scaling a business; by employing them and training we encourage this
<p>we ask how people how likely they are to refer and get an NPS of 83
<p>they tell us their abilities and where they want tow ork and their home address and we make empathetic schedules
<p>there is an on demand aspect to the business but there is a massive recurring element which eases scheduling
<p>we think about on demand as having enough slack in the system to support that on top of scheduled
<p>we wanted to have super high employee retention, so we wanted people to eb abel to grow and develop in the company
<p>there is path to progress from an operator to a mentor to a supervisor, and some become account managers or QA engs
<p>whetehr you work in the office or the field, everyone is an operator, and everyone cleans, even engineers
<p>this has huge results as the engineers have to actually use the operator app
<p>the field operators seeing the office employees in the fields makes a difference
<p>the base benefits offered to managers and software engineers are the same as for the operators too
<p>every quarter after I present to the board I then present to the operator assembly too
<p>a lot fo the handymen were lone wolves and then they come in the house and then become part of the team
