<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://werd.io/'>Ben Werdmüller</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>this is <a class="auto-link" href="http://withknown.com">withknown.com</a> as you have seen it before - but this has a new tab called community
<p>community has content from everyone's domain on campus, it obeys permissions
<p>people at an institution are automatically subscribed to the personal domains of everyone in the community
<p>this is decentralised aggregation with a search engine on campus - there is an institutional aggregator
<p>there is also a public portal of all public posts and a directory of users
<p>we are going to build the community tab into every known site so I can follow you, even though I use woodwind
<p>It's all indieweb under the hood, but it has a bit of a search engine for each community
<p>we will get all the institutional search engines to speak to each other as hubs
<p>we heard "I don't care about owning my website, but I want to own my data and find my friends"

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>another thing we have got working recently is the idea of person tagging not just to our sites but to silos
<p>we had person-tagging between indieweb sites, now we have Ryan and Kyle to demo

<p>we send webmentions, but if you don't have webmentions we will send them to your blog as comments
<p>we now support flickr too - likes and comments come bak to your site, and also publish with person tags
<p>we looked for more stuff to send back to your site - we now send links from twitter as well
<p>we also have pagination and retry for webmentions on your site
<p>for every kind of thing on facebook there are 5 or 10 urls, we handle all of those now
<p>we pay attention to semantics more carefully now about what is a like and what is a mention
<p>we are also telling the differnence between syndicatiion and reposting

<p>what I want to do is team up with a dev and upload to one place and have it create albums on facebook and my site
<p>So this would be a good project for indiewebcamp in december
<p>I am keen to explore new UI for galleries

<p>I think my version looks nicer than twitter's here and both twitter and facebook have the emoji combining wrong
<p>I got implied linked image syntax - I auto embed an image URL - if the next thing is another URL I link the image to it
<p>it bugged me that on other sites the url was showing up, and this now looks better

<p>I work at livefyre, and I have been working to make our comments more indie friendly by having an OAuth 2 api
<p>I have implemented OpenID Connect login for Livefyre so I can auth against this
