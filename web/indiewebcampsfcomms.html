<a class='h-card' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>I wrote <a href="http://tantek.com/2013/338/b1/people-focused-mobile-communication-experience" >this post</a> because I was frustrated with which app to talk to whom
<p>also, every time I open an app the queued messages show up and distract me from what i was trying to do
<p>what if instead you choose the person first, then have links to all the ways people can talk to you?

<a class='h-card' href='http://kevinmarks.com'>Kevin Marks</a>:  <blockquote><p>you can do bits of this with iMessage or android, but they choose the contact model for you
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>I might want to be contacted by random people on AIM, but if you indieauth in, it will show you more options
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://snarfed.org/'>Ryan Barrett</a>:  <blockquote><p>the way we do ACLs now is someone else logs in with indieauth, which is a huge ask
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://kevinmarks.com'>Kevin Marks</a>:  <blockquote><p>if you want a shim, you can detect facebook and twitter with client-side iframes if they aren't logged in
<p></blockquote>
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>I keep the to-do list for my site code  Falcon on http://indiewebcamp.com/falcon so it's public domain
<p>I have contact, create&meet and elsewhere. I'd like to add "pay me" too
<p>If you go via my site I can vary what contact method to show when
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://wavis.org/'>wavis</a>:  <blockquote><p>I think this is the problem - knowing how to contact people when
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://snarfed.org/'>Ryan Barrett</a>:  <blockquote><p>the high cognitive load is that everyone's "contact me" UX will be different, whicg creates cognitive load too
<p>I want to have the visual muscle memory to do the same
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://aaronparecki.com'>Aaron Parecki</a>:  <blockquote><p>if we use microformats, hCard, we can have a plugin that converges these for any given site
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://snarfed.org/'>Ryan Barrett</a>:  <blockquote><p>I have a half-finished user style for hCard that does this, but I need someone better with CSS and JS
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>If we get the markup right, we can share a CSS style that does this well.
<p>usually I'm OK with "ship something crappy and iterate it" but this needs to be at least as good as native
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://wavis.org/'>wavis</a>:  <blockquote><p>can we take out the grid? can it just try automatically?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://aaronparecki.com'>Aaron Parecki</a>:  <blockquote><p>getting the user preferences is tricky because you are matching both sides' preferences
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>I have some friends who only use AIM, others who only use gTalk you need to meet their UX
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://wavis.org/'>wavis</a>:  <blockquote><p>I want to add multiplexing - I want to read and or send with one interface
<p>we want status messaging too - know what is possible then
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>that is what is done live on the server - my apps can update the availability of the server
<p>if you look at a Windows phone it is based on people centric UI, but ti just expresses your addressbook 
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://snarfed.org/'>Ryan Barrett</a>:  <blockquote><p>silos have started to do this- they can route preferences but they are silo'd
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>can we collect the URI schemes for launching all these apps?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://snarfed.org/'>Ryan Barrett</a>:  <blockquote><p>there are fairly well-documented ways to find the URLs for iOS/Android etc
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>i want to hack on this tomorrow morning. The stretch goal is to do it doing purely with web standards websockets/WebRTC
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://adambrault.com'>Adam Brault</a>:  <blockquote><p>we have a way to do peer to peer but fall back on silos 
<p>the challenge of WebRTC is it it peer to peer and you have to bring your own signalling
<p>it should be the most federated example - this is why we combine xmpp with WebRTC
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://aaronparecki.com'>Aaron Parecki</a>:  <blockquote><p>could I do signalling that is not XMPP?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://adambrault.com'>Adam Brault</a>:  <blockquote><p>yes you don't have to use XMPP, we can build a signalling mechanism
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://aaronparecki.com'>Aaron Parecki</a>:  <blockquote><p>as long as we have servers, we can do the discovery right?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://kevinmarks.com'>Kevin Marks</a>:  <blockquote><p>the challenge is routing between clients and discovering IP+port - if you have a server you can make this work
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://adambrault.com'>Adam Brault</a>:  <blockquote><p>  github.com/andyet/signalmaster is a signal server that talky.io uses, you could run this
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://kevinmarks.com'>Kevin Marks</a>:  <blockquote><p>if you want a shim, you can detect facebook and twitter with client-side iframes if they aren't logged in
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://dunlaps.net/darius'>Darius C. Dunlap</a>:  <blockquote><p>if it's blue you're in iMessage, if it's green it's SMS
<p>this is a cool idea - it's  piece of doing the next step of bringing them to my website first
<p>at least it's a nascar that it is situationally aware
