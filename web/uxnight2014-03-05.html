<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.idreamofdesign.com'>andi galpern</a>:  <blockquote><p>welcome everyone - we are recording so there will be a link later
<p>UX Night happens on the first or third wednesday every month - organised by CascadeSF
<p>here is a story about 2 nerdsâ€¦ @mdo+@smiley: that's us!
<p>Mr Jonathan Smiley @smiley moved from Birmingham, AL to SF to work at ZURB in Sept 2008
<p>He met @mdo and a friendship was born, but mark left in 2010 to work at twitter on Bootstrap
<p>August 2011 Boostrap was launched by @mdo + @fat, November 2011 Foundation launched by @smiley

<a class='h-card' href='http://foundation.zurb.com'>Jonathan Smiley</a>:  <blockquote><p>A framework is patterns and best practices and shortcuts to get you to do things quickly
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://markdotto.com'>Mark Otto</a>:  <blockquote><p>they're patterns and templates  we do all the grunt work so you don't have to
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.idreamofdesign.com'>andi galpern</a>:  <blockquote><p>Paul Boag said the purpose of a framework was a pattern library to ensure design consistency
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://markdotto.com'>Mark Otto</a>:  <blockquote><p>there's one called TukTuk, they claim to be not bootstrap
<p>there's one called Ratchet - Jacob and COnner made that too
<p>we did a lot of work for clients of different sizes, so we made style guides, 1st in photoshop, then html+css
<p>the inspiration for zurb style guide was a gnereal template for all the client code
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.idreamofdesign.com'>andi galpern</a>:  <blockquote><p>so a framework is a style guide?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://foundation.zurb.com'>Jonathan Smiley</a>:  <blockquote><p>Foundation came about from style guides for each client, starting with a barebones grid
<p>after a while we saw every client needed similar things
<p>the advantage of giving clinets style guides is that it empowers them to build things themselves without you
<p>we decided to abstract the Zurb style guide , so it was fully general. Foundation 5.2 is out today
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.idreamofdesign.com'>andi galpern</a>:  <blockquote><p>if you want to get in a better mood, go to the bootstrap blog which has a 90s dance party for each release
<p>if I wanted to design my own framework what would I do?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://foundation.zurb.com'>Jonathan Smiley</a>:  <blockquote><p>don't design your own. it's a cool coding exercise but it's a lot of work. existing ones are sophisticted
<p>figure out the things you use repeatedly, that there are lots of, and do them in the best way possible
<p>when you design something you need to be opinionated, and people will fuck you up about it
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.idreamofdesign.com'>andi galpern</a>:  <blockquote><p>if you're doing a style guide and list of patterns - what then?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://markdotto.com'>Mark Otto</a>:  <blockquote><p>both Bootstrap and Foundation will let you decide which bit to strip out for  style guide
<p>you make some grids, buttons, forms and table styles and off you go, but testing it on lots of devices is hard
<p>you can fork bootstrap and foundation as they are both MIT licencsed
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://foundation.zurb.com'>Jonathan Smiley</a>:  <blockquote><p>there are a lot of companies that now release their styleguides - mailchimp has one
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.idreamofdesign.com'>andi galpern</a>:  <blockquote><p>what happened with LESS? Is that still part of bootstrap?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://markdotto.com'>Mark Otto</a>:  <blockquote><p>When I started out I used LESS because I didn't know what a gem was so couldn't use SASS
<p>LESS is basically on par since SASS. there is a SASS port for bootstrap now
<p>I work in github where everythign is SASS, but the rest of the day is LESS for bootstrap
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://foundation.zurb.com'>Jonathan Smiley</a>:  <blockquote><p>we rebuilt foundation ins SASS for Foundation 3, and ZURB has always been a rails shop so gems weren't a problem
<p>we've always used SASS, I've never used LESS so they seem pretty similar
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://markdotto.com'>Mark Otto</a>:  <blockquote><p>LESS and SASS have their own opinions; eventually this should go into CSS itself
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://foundation.zurb.com'>Jonathan Smiley</a>:  <blockquote><p>that would be preferable to move all this into CSS - lets pretend CSS working group could get it done
<p>pros and cons - pros there's a lot you don't have to do, as someone has done it 
<p>it'll take care of grid and responsiveness and javascript - you don't need to know a lot of javascript if you use one
<p>you don't have to QA as much in a framework; you can rely on stuff working in any browser
<p>the reason we made foundation was they we would spend hours on QA, and the framework learned
<p>this was 5 years ago, so we had to use IE6 and IE7 so it was a world of pain
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://markdotto.com'>Mark Otto</a>:  <blockquote><p>the other thing about grameworks is that end up really well documented - what you can do, and importantly what you can't do
<p>the cons: it's easy to get stuck in what other people are doing, the same thing over and over
<p>it's easy to not get to the point where you do something new on top
<p>you may find that the team on the framework doesn't want to do what you want
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://foundation.zurb.com'>Jonathan Smiley</a>:  <blockquote><p>you get a lot of stuff for free, but you only get what the framework wants to give you
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://markdotto.com'>Mark Otto</a>:  <blockquote><p>there are also a lot of extensions and plugins for the frameworks too
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.idreamofdesign.com'>andi galpern</a>:  <blockquote><p>is there a way to develop these so that it is easy to upgrade to the next version without breaking templates
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://foundation.zurb.com'>Jonathan Smiley</a>:  <blockquote><p>things change from version to version, especially with a major version number
<p>we make decisions that are supposed to work for a while
<p>in Foundation 4 we removed Tabs and made them into sections that were tab/accordions 
<p>in foundation 5 we reinstituted tabs and accordions, and broke all your sections, so sorry about that
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://markdotto.com'>Mark Otto</a>:  <blockquote><p>bootstrap is used for a lot of internal sites but it is now being used in production too
<p>the web moves fast and slow at the same time. we have to break some things now and then
<p>we're not having to work on IE6 any more; foundation doesn't support IE8, and we'll drop that next
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://foundation.zurb.com'>Jonathan Smiley</a>:  <blockquote><p>we run into this all the time - "we just built our website on foundation 4, how do we upgrade?" Don't
<p>You cna do the big new cool thing, and in all likelihood screw your product and company
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://markdotto.com'>Mark Otto</a>:  <blockquote><p>you cab upgrade point releases easily, but don't do major versions
<p>The big jumps we're going to break things so that we can stay sane. Save it for your next thing
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://foundation.zurb.com'>Jonathan Smiley</a>:  <blockquote><p>we have things at zurb still on foundation 0.8 - you don't need to migrate everything
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://markdotto.com'>Mark Otto</a>:  <blockquote><p>we don't do usability studies directly on bootstrap. we get feedback on twitter and hacker news. HN we can leave
<p>we have 13,000 issues on github that have been fixed, so we get feedback
<p>we have a private repo for our next version, and we migrate issues from 3 to 4 when we see it
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://foundation.zurb.com'>Jonathan Smiley</a>:  <blockquote><p>anybody who works on these frameworks is an egomaniacal control freak bastard. We're opinionated
<p>we can tell people who have good reasoning
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://markdotto.com'>Mark Otto</a>:  <blockquote><p>if you see the same thing reported several times, that's a clue. The crowd mentality works
<p>the hard part of open source is that you show everyone what you're thinking
<p>i find that I piss people off easily, so can I apologise to the entire internet now in advance
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://foundation.zurb.com'>Jonathan Smiley</a>:  <blockquote><p>there are times when someone has a great idea, but it would fit Pure better than bootstrap
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://markdotto.com'>Mark Otto</a>:  <blockquote><p>Jacob did a great talk on what is open source and why do I feel so guilty
<p>I get 60 notifications a day on github just from bootstrap so I have had to build up a team to handle it
<p>with 5 million sites out there we feel responsible for a lot of other people
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://foundation.zurb.com'>Jonathan Smiley</a>:  <blockquote><p>5 years ago if you'd said 'are you going to make a thing that 100s of thousands of people use" we'd have said No Way
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://markdotto.com'>Mark Otto</a>:  <blockquote><p>if I have misread your issue and closed it without talking to you, let me know
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.idreamofdesign.com'>andi galpern</a>:  <blockquote><p>we all want to make the next big thing, but we can get stuck updating
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://markdotto.com'>Mark Otto</a>:  <blockquote><p>whatever you work on, you can't fix everyone's issues it's hard
<p>5 people on bootstrap full time
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://foundation.zurb.com'>Jonathan Smiley</a>:  <blockquote><p>there are about 5 engineers and 4 designers on foundation each day 
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://markdotto.com'>Mark Otto</a>:  <blockquote><p>github has an environment where you can work at any time 
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.idreamofdesign.com'>andi galpern</a>:  <blockquote><p>if you haven't seen @mdo's coding style guide you should it's on his github
<p>what is the difference in naming convention? @mdo: it was my choice @smiley: and mine
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://foundation.zurb.com'>Jonathan Smiley</a>:  <blockquote><p>with foundation we wanted people to come up to speed quickly, so it is very human readable
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://markdotto.com'>Mark Otto</a>:  <blockquote><p>there are examples of people building for both bootstrap and foundation
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://foundation.zurb.com'>Jonathan Smiley</a>:  <blockquote><p>we do have a lot of similar things between bootstrap and foundation, as there are only so many kinds of things
<p>both our frameworks and others are reasonably opinionated, find one that fits you
<p>we always wanted foundation to be as easy to modify as possible - it used to be ugly out of the box
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://markdotto.com'>Mark Otto</a>:  <blockquote><p>the biggest one is SASS vs LESS, though Bootstrap 3.1 has a SASS port. 
<p>in bootstrap we wrote our own CSS linter for LESS which makes it a very legible, and not too nested
<p>make sure design talks to engineering. We're all smart, intelligent good-looking people trying to do cool things on the net
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://foundation.zurb.com'>Jonathan Smiley</a>:  <blockquote><p>if something doesn't work, what are you going to do? Zurb can support foundation
<p>this is assuming your deign team does anything with code and cares - they should!
<p>neither of us would have dreamed of this. Its flattering. Not humbling because we have enormous egos
