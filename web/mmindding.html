<p><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://commstudies.utexas.edu/faculty/organizational-communication/dawna-ballard'>Dawna Ballard</a>:  <blockquote><p>we don't like to think of technology as deterministic, as we only use things that we find value in
<p>the limitations of multitasking come from taking the tasking model and trying to split it up
<p>interaction quadrants defined by synchronous/asynchronous and colocated/remote
<p>Thompson described tasking as the more sophisticated, clock driven culture as opposed to the agrarian relational

<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://leshed.comm.cornell.edu/'>Gilly Leshed</a>:  <blockquote><p>we have different spaces within our lives - work/home Apps tend to be in a single mindedness mindset
<p>if you're on the phone while at home with the family, your mind is still at work
<p>what happens when home and work merge? I interviewed a lot of small farmers about how it works together
<p>We need to bring natural rhythms into the design space - seasonal cycles and longer
<p>think about dividing spaces in a way that is not just home/work/school but different connected communities

<a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@fmc'>Faith Chiang</a>:  <blockquote><p>I was initially working on mmindding tools in the personal space, but it applies to <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/firstrain">@firstrain</a> ideas too
<p>what <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/firstrain">@firstrain</a> does is construct a business web graph - if you can read everything around the company you can model them
<p>relationships are not linear - they are within a context and depend on perspective
<p>what helps us keep on top of this is clustering concepts around a market - they may not be named, but the clusters exist
<p>we teach our systems to be skeptical too and look for possible artefacts in the data
<p>The Challenger Methodology: keep providing your customer with interesting insights into their industry over time
<p>we help salespeople choose whom to call today and what to talk about by framing the news for them
<p>we analyse our users too to see what kind of information density that they need - we adjust what we show accordingly
<p>we look at your calender and generate a meeting brief just before you walk in
