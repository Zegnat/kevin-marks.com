This morning on Twitter Anil Dash and I had a bit of a back and forth:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet h-cite" lang="en" data-conversation="none"><p class="e-content">Hi, it&#39;s been two years, will somebody go build this set of tools and go make millions of dollars please? <a href="http://t.co/jLX0Dp5DxI">http://t.co/jLX0Dp5DxI</a></p>&mdash; Anil Dash Dot Com (@anildash) <a class="u-url" href="https://twitter.com/anildash/status/555408559450906624">January 14, 2015</a></blockquote>

Marco Rogers chided me for being short with Anil:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet h-cite" lang="en" data-conversation="none"><p class="e-content"><a href="https://twitter.com/kevinmarks">@kevinmarks</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/anildash">@anildash</a> these are feature requests.

This is a fair point, and so here is a post going into more detail. 
<p>The quoted parts are from <a href="http://dashes.com/anil/2013/04/i-like-blogging-software.html">Anil's blog post</a> - I'll respond inline:
<blockquote class="h-cite">
<p>So, my contribution is to collect some of the notes I've been gathering for the last few years about what I'd like to see in a blogging tool. I know there are apps with many, perhaps even all, of these features, but I'd like to see one emerge as a leading platform for doing innovative work. </blockquote>
Here Anil is explicitly calling out for a monoculture, rather than a set of interoperable  tools and protocols. This is understandable, give his history with Six Apart, which built several products in that way, and indeed seeing the success of silos, their monolithic nature can be seen as contributing to this. With indieweb we are trying a different approach by working through our own wishlists, reusing common components, and making sure we interoperate along the way. This gives us a composable set of tools that do plug together - the tool kit Anil both is and isn't asking for.
<blockquote class="h-cite">
<p>My blogging features wishlist:</p>

<ul>
<li>I enter markdown in plain text files; these are stored on Dropbox/Google Drive/Skydrive and/or S3 and/or GitHub.</li>
<li>The system renders those plain files into <span class="caps">JSON </span>assets in a documented format.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
There are lots of indieweb tools that work in this kind of way; but Anil is very focused on the specifics of formats. Markdown is one popular way of writing text for posts; indeed many indieweb tools support it; json is handy as an interchange format between programming languages, but as Anil says, having a common format is useful. What we realised working on indieweb is thet we already have a lingua franca for webpages and blogs, and that is HTML. Ultimately all sites publish in this format, so using that and adjusting it minimally to make interop easier is the approach we took. 
<p>Our documented format is Microformats2, which for blog posts involves h-entry and h-feed as common structure, with additional microformats to label other reusable features. Generating HTML from Markdown is relatively straightforward, if not always deterministic, as that was its design goal. Gnerating JSON from HTML formatted wiht microformats 2 is also straghtforward and more determinisiic.
<p>Storing source files in various cloud services is practical adn indeed done by many indieweb tools, but requiring a specific cloud services file system is less flexible and general than using HTML on the web itself, so that's what we do.
<blockquote class="h-cite">
<ul><li>A Bootstrap-themed reading client app lives at my site, on my domain, and reads a single simple config file to learn how to display and navigate between those <span class="caps">JSON </span>assets. This client app would also have to handle <span class="caps">URL </span>routing and persisting states, while ideally also keeping preferences and reading history for readers.</li>
<li>The default theme offers a YouTube-style browsing view of all my content, where people can make playlists of posts (this is equivalent to navigating my archives by tag), embed my posts on their own sites, and easily explore by traditional groupings like category or date.</li></ul></blockquote>
<p>This is a lot of fragiilty - the default Blogger template switched to a JSON model like this and consequently fails to render a lot fo the time. Twitter too used an all-JSON web app for a while, before reverting to HTML+json enhancements. The fragility comes from JSON being much less resilient to encoding or writing errors than HTML - HTML5 specifys how to consistently handle invalid or poorly marked-up HTML pages, with JSON you will get a parse error and lose the whole page. BY using HTML instead for your format, the page can be read on every platform by default. Now, behind the scenes JSON can be useful - indeed Known uses a JSON store for its posts database, but exposing this publicly will likely lead to decay over time.
<p>We are beginning to see indieweb reader apps that work by parsing the h-feed and h-entry markup published, and give the remixability that Anil mentions, but they are an augmentation to the basic page, not a required path along the way. 
<blockquote class="h-cite">
<p><ul>
<li>There might be an optional administration interface separate for me, just for editing the markdown files through a plain text in-browser editor; In this case, it should be a responsive app that works in all my browsers.</li></ul></blockquote>
<p>On the indieweb, this is handled by two protocols: micropub and indieauth. Indieauth lets you prove that you are the owner of the site by logging in, so you can get editing privileges or other enhanced versions.
<p>Micropub is a simple protocol, based on HTML forms, to let you edit and publish posts and notes. BY using these two it is possible th have multiple different tools to create and edit posts, independent of the mechanics of their storage, as they also use HTML for interchange.
<blockquote class="h-cite">
<p><ul>
<li>Ideally comments are handled as small messages in a documented json format, sent between instances of this blogging application. Of course in the short term I would just embed Disqus/Facebook/Google-style comments until that infrastructure was further along.</li></ul></blockquote>
<p>for comments we use the same documented HTML format, but add he idea of a webmention. This is a simple protocol that enables you to send a link to your post or comment that responds (mentions) another post. The webmention receiver can parse this, check it does link to it, and interpret it as a comment, a reply, and repost, a like or an RSVP depending on the format. 
<blockquote class="h-cite">
<p><ul>
<li>Having a documented format for the json objects which represent posts and comments would permit transclusion and sending of posts between sites, in a manner analogous to how <a href="http://fargo.io/">Fargo</a> does this for outliners, and in a way that would bring back some of the positives of TrackBack in the early blogosphere.</li></ul></blockquote>
<p>Exactly! Webmention does this, but with verification and context, and that means that it can be used for reposting, but also for threaded comments, per-paragraph annotations and other things we haven't though of yet.
<blockquote class="h-cite">
<p><ul>
<li>"Themes" would largely be implemented as Bootstrap <span class="caps">CSS </span>stylesheets, with some affordance for separate content modules. By default, themes are public so I would just be able to tell an admin app to import a theme from your site so I could remix it.</li></ul></blockquote>
<p>By using
<blockquote class="h-cite">
<p><ul>
<li>The <span class="caps">API </span>endpoint for discovering the json representations of content would double as the <span class="caps">API </span>for others to access my data to build around it; Eventually a posting app which saved <span class="caps">POST</span>s of that json format as fiels in dropbox would allow a write <span class="caps">API.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>I think that's it for now. Let me know if somebody's got all these boxes checked on their platform today, but I suspect the hardest part is the client app for readers, which works in a way analogous to an <span class="caps">RSS </span>reader or email client, but would have to support a new format and would be optimized for clean reading and subsequent discovery, rather than the three-pane model which has dominated those apps for the last decade or two.</p>
