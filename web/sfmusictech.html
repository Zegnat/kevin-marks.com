<h2>Music, Tech & Money</h2>
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.waldenvc.com'>Larry Marcus</a>: I like investing in music startups because no-one else does, but I avoid where you have to do label licensing
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.waldenvc.com'>Larry Marcus</a>: I think people want to pay artists, but have had less access to do so.
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.waldenvc.com'>Larry Marcus</a>: BandPage is helping to empower bands in a new way, but not by making money form the selling of music
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.waldenvc.com'>Larry Marcus</a>: The big challenge for the music industry—the content holders—is to generate a friendly environment for innovation
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.mayfield.com'>tim chang</a>: Music is historically about an aspirational industry or story. EDM is not selling music but experience, a story
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.mayfield.com'>tim chang</a>: If you can sell an experience, or the dream of an experience, you have something
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://ggvc.com'>hnada</a>: If you look at what the game industry has become, the top 1% is >50% of yur revenue, the bottom 50%<1%
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://ggvc.com'>hnada</a>: unlike games music is still charging the whales and minnows the same for each song, which is why you need experiences
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.waldenvc.com'>Larry Marcus</a>: the venues own advertising
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.waldenvc.com'>Larry Marcus</a>: I think there is a business coming in a streamed live show, expanding the live audience online
<p><a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@KaterinaMarkov'>Katerina</a>: There is potential with a mobile app attached to a live performance, so you can do it without the venue
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://ggvc.com'>hnada</a>: If you have a large enough audience, fans out there are willing to give you a lot of money - Kickstarter shows this
<p><a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@KaterinaMarkov'>Katerina</a>: I'm not sure a bigger artist would take $10,000 to have dinner with them
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.mayfield.com'>tim chang</a>: If you spend $10,000 to have dinner with an artist, you're buying a story to tell your friends about
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://ggvc.com'>hnada</a>: A chinese startup that lets you throw flowers ($1) or tomatos ($10) at amateur karaoke artists. Artists get 30%
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.mayfield.com'>tim chang</a>: Minnows aren't worthless. Without them there, the whales have no-one to show off to. 
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.mayfield.com'>tim chang</a>: people either have time or money. You can charge money or get them to do something for you with their time
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://ggvc.com'>hnada</a>: I got to play soundcheck drums with a band, and have a Bud with them backstage. I was a god to my friends
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://ggvc.com'>hnada</a>: I bought this backstage for $50 a head on bandcamp  - I'd have paid more. I'm a whale, hit me up.
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://ggvc.com'>hnada</a>: We need to work out how to get these platforms to make more money for themselves and for the artists
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.waldenvc.com'>Larry Marcus</a>: There are 50k-70k angel deals done each year. They are relatively easy to get. Maybe 600 VC GP's exist
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.waldenvc.com'>Larry Marcus</a>: When you try to get to the series A, there aren't enough VCs; more angels ease this crunch
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.waldenvc.com'>Larry Marcus</a>: Angelist has made it easier to get funding, but there's lots of danger in those waters. Do it if you really care.
<p><a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@KaterinaMarkov'>Katerina</a>: Angelist just introduced syndicates, which makes it easier for some apps to raise money faster
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.mayfield.com'>tim chang</a>: It's cheaper then ever to launch a company, but more expensive than ever to scale a company
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.mayfield.com'>tim chang</a>: be careful of VCs - we will push you off a cliff trying to get to 500M scale business in music
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.mayfield.com'>tim chang</a>: music is a great place for a lifestyle business, but VCs can mess it up fast
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://ggvc.com'>hnada</a>: I don't think we need more artists, I think we need more managers. many artists don't know how to run a business model
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.waldenvc.com'>Larry Marcus</a>: Music is as important as sport to kids, band+team, practice, etc. Music as an expense, not a job
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.waldenvc.com'>Larry Marcus</a>: Free guitar videos on YouTube isn't always the way (hi @soundslice)
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.mayfield.com'>tim chang</a>: People want to feel like being a musician - RockBand did that. EDM is another form of this - mixing and producing
<p><a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@KaterinaMarkov'>Katerina</a>: YouTube has become a huge platform for artists to grow big enough to need a management company like us
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://ggvc.com'>hnada</a>: Even though app discovery is horrible, it's still better than music discovery. We can learn from app stores

<p><a class='h-card' href='http://ggvc.com'>hnada</a>:  <blockquote><p>I think there si lots to learn from other media markets like apps in the music industry
<p>I think you're going to see a lot more data analytics and insights in music
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.mayfield.com'>tim chang</a>:  <blockquote><p>think how much revenue apps get from cross-promotion adverts. Music doesn't even think of this 
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.waldenvc.com'>Larry Marcus</a>:  <blockquote><p>discovery is poor, search is terrible, playlisting is messy. We need statutory licensing fro on-demand streaming
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://ggvc.com'>hnada</a>:  <blockquote><p>every time I hear the word licensing I put my hands over my ears and go "la la la"
<p>the Jobs act? you mean the Ponzi scheme act? It's great for companies, tough for investors
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.waldenvc.com'>Larry Marcus</a>:  <blockquote><p>There isn't a lot of oversight and knowledge in the crowd funding area. We're going to need that
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.mayfield.com'>tim chang</a>:  <blockquote><p>How are the dynamics different overseas? @hnada: most musicians in china make nothing form recored music
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://ggvc.com'>hnada</a>:  <blockquote><p>we've learned from China about how artists make money without selling recordings and are bringing that back
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.waldenvc.com'>Larry Marcus</a>:  <blockquote><p>everyone should have 20,000 apps on their phone
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@KaterinaMarkov'>Katerina</a>:  <blockquote><p>when you have an artist app you have access to all kinds of info you don't know from iTunes or spotify
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.mayfield.com'>tim chang</a>:  <blockquote><p>most apps for artists have just been glorified websites. What would Uber for artists be like?
<p>we need something other than news, content and ads in that app
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.waldenvc.com'>Larry Marcus</a>:  <blockquote><p>to make a Brand great takes a huge amount of effort. When you white label that, it gets very expensive
<p>It's very painful to have bunch of these artist apps. It's not their business doing this right
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://ggvc.com'>hnada</a>:  <blockquote><p>I have 26 music apps on my phone, none of them are artist apps.
<p>I have 20 top ten bands. I don't want an app for each, but one app to rule them all
<p>remember when every website wanted to give you an email address? that sucked ass. I like my gmail
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.mayfield.com'>tim chang</a>:  <blockquote><p>it's all about properly segmenting and scaling all these different tiers of experience - scarce and price
<p>check out tspring - a t-shirt that si a token to show I supported an artist - everyone wants to tell a story
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://ggvc.com'>hnada</a>:  <blockquote><p>to monetize an audience, you need to know psychology, economics and merchandising. game co's have econonomists on staff
<p>you need a lot of expertise to make money on these offers. I've seen bands lose money on kickstarter rewards
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.mayfield.com'>tim chang</a>:  <blockquote><p>I think the future of music is in selling STEM tracks - next gen will work this out and charge more
<p>the future of musicianship will be grabbing STEMs on the fly to mix into their own versions
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.waldenvc.com'>Larry Marcus</a>:  <blockquote><p>There is so much gear that is going to get replaced by an iPad or a tablet. Except subwoofers. They're still good
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://ggvc.com'>hnada</a>:  <blockquote><p> think about the NFL - half the audience doesn't pay, but they charge more and more for boxes, on-pitch etc Segmenting
<p>the average american spends 4 hours a week watching sports, 40 hours on music, yet we're 1/6th the size
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@KaterinaMarkov'>Katerina</a>:  <blockquote><p>there are very few celebrity investors who are worth investing with. Align with one who makes sense for you
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.waldenvc.com'>Larry Marcus</a>:  <blockquote><p>a broad array of tools is needed for managers. Dealing with tech isn't what you value [@ev's convenience rule?]
<p>a management tool dealing with unsold tickets and filling up shows would be really valuable. Increase shows attended
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@KaterinaMarkov'>Katerina</a>:  <blockquote><p>data is really valuable. There is a real gap for data analytics int he music space, We need visualizations
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.mayfield.com'>tim chang</a>:  <blockquote><p>you should manage your artists like startup, because that's what artists are like now.
<p>you should be able to segment your entire audience like Vegas does- whale/minnow split
<p>the best bands work where there is one dictator, not an equal split so you can just convince one person
</blockquote>

<h2>Monetizing YouTube</h2>
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/'>Alex Pham</a>:  <blockquote><p>YouTube makes adsense $ - what else? Sponsorship; UGC publishing your covers; Subscriptions; merchandise sales
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@KevinGrosch'>Kevin Grosch</a>:  <blockquote><p>instead of thinking of a site as just a place to upload random stuff, think about longform content
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://blog.audiam.com'>Jeff Price</a>:  <blockquote><p>on your own videos when you control the copyright, you can earn ads; on songs there are other rightsholders too
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@conte'>Jack Conte</a>:  <blockquote><p>a lot of people make a living off youtube videos - a generation of them. Patreon is a way other than clickthrough ads
<p>Patreon lets you say "will you give me $5 every time I make a video?" - instead of CPMs it pays on engagement
<p>A creator with 100,000 subscribers has a football stadium full of people. doesn't pay enough with ads to make a living
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@adrevnet'>AdRev</a>:  <blockquote><p>when people upload your content without your permission, there is a huge opportunity to make money from that
<p>there's about $300M a year going out of youtube to music rightsholders Isaac Bess: it's even more than that
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://blog.audiam.com'>Jeff Price</a>:  <blockquote><p>i want you all to make lots of money, but you aren't all hit artists, so you won't
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@conte'>Jack Conte</a>:  <blockquote><p>I'm not talking about future lady gagas, I'm talking about the emergent middle class of artists you haven't heard of
<p>there are a lot of companies that take advantage of engagement to make artists money 
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@adrevnet'>AdRev</a>:  <blockquote><p>there are bands that make significant money just from the ads on fan-uploaded videos
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/'>Alex Pham</a>:  <blockquote><p>artists are releasing tracks specially for fans to remix and post video from them to YouTube so they get ads
<p>when you're watching the 100 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute, what mistakes do you see?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@KevinGrosch'>Kevin Grosch</a>:  <blockquote><p>Use they advice in the Youtube playbook: http://www.youtube.com/yt/playbook/
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@adrevnet'>AdRev</a>:  <blockquote><p>people aren't always watching the videos on youtube, they're using it as a way to bring audio to their ears.
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://blog.audiam.com'>Jeff Price</a>:  <blockquote><p>Three is a band called moones that have buttons across their video that shows them more+more drunk as you click
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@conte'>Jack Conte</a>:  <blockquote><p>I saw someone make a choose your own adventure out of YouTube annotations, with different dance moves conneceted
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.youtube.com/jackcontemusic'>Jack Conte</a>:  <blockquote><p>the creator community has been in an uproar about certain things. we miss video responses, for example
<p>Changing subscriptions to be no longer chronological is a problem for creators wanting people to see their newest
<p>YouTube is one of the most incredible platforms for audience building - monetising can come after that.
<p>nothing is like youtube for building audience. If you have 25,000 views at a $2 CPM you can make money other ways
<p>small business creators didn't exist before free publishing and distribution
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://blog.audiam.com'>Jeff Price</a>:  <blockquote><p>you never know what is going to be a hit, from Zoubi Zoo to Harlem Shake. Tech makes more lottery tickets
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/'>Alex Pham</a>:  <blockquote><p>Does madison Avenue want to have individual conversations? Won't they buy in bulk rather than contact @jackconte?</blockquote>
