<p><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>welcome to the second Homebrew Website Club of February, 4th of the year
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='https://kylewm.com'>KyleWm</a>:  <blockquote><p>I changed <a class="auto-link" href="http://reader.kylewm.com">reader.kylewm.com</a> to support pubsubhubbub so it updates in real time now
<p>last week I was having trouble with suprfeeder being able to subscribe but <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/julien51">@julien51</a> fixed it
<p>using <a class="auto-link" href="http://kylewm.superfeedr.com">kylewm.superfeedr.com</a> now works try it out
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='https://darius.dunlaps.net'>Darius Dunlap</a>:  <blockquote><p>I moved my hosting to a Digital Ocean droplet and I'm going to post on how to do this on  <a class="auto-link" href="https://darius.dunlaps.net">https://darius.dunlaps.net</a>
<p>there's a lot of nginx config to set up so my POSSE stuff can work on the new site
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>it's important to document how long this config stuff takes
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='https://darius.dunlaps.net'>Darius Dunlap</a>:  <blockquote><p>part of it for me was relearning the new sysadmin ways - nginx vs apache
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://kevinmarks.com'>Kevin Marks</a>:  <blockquote><p>I am trying to use <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/medium">@medium</a> to pst to my site - it now involves using their export process and editing the HTML
<p>if <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/medium">@medium</a> is serious about blogging it would be great if they supported micropub
<p>in other news, Blogger has giving bloggers with Adult content until monday to make their blogs private
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@kabula'>lbugeja</a>:  <blockquote><p>I have a portfolio that I coded myself; now I am trying squarespace as hosting for my own site
<p>the e-commerce and blog there is really easy to create. However you have to follow their grid and layout
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='https://darius.dunlaps.net'>Darius Dunlap</a>:  <blockquote><p>i've set up a couple of people on squarespace; there is a developer api
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@kabula'>lbugeja</a>:  <blockquote><p>i do like how easy to is to blog using squarespace - it feels a bit like cheating
<p>do I want to bake my own bread and be really proud of it, or do I want to buy bread
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://meta.ly'>Elisa Jo Harkness</a>:  <blockquote><p>it's like having a bread machine 
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@kabula'>lbugeja</a>:  <blockquote><p>yes, as ai paid money for squarespace it is just like a bread machine
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>I got RSVPs saying no and maybe , and remote attending - previously I only coded how to say yes to events
<p>a public maybe makes sense, but a public no doesn't often, but being stuck in Sydney meant I had to cancel an event
<p>remote attending isn't a yes/no/maybe - it is another kind of thing
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://kevinmarks.com'>Kevin Marks</a>:  <blockquote><p>most  event systems don't let you have multiple locations; only online events
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://meta.ly'>Elisa Jo Harkness</a>:  <blockquote><p>a webinar conveys a remote seminar but is rarely anything like a seminar as it isn't people interacting 
<p>most webinars are a broadcast lecture or a dialog between speaker and one remote, not socratic dialogue
<p>every time someone talks about disrupting higher education it is about having more people here a lecture
<p>in the humanities you do the reading at home, but the discussion is the important part
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>what we are doing here is more like a seminar
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://kevinmarks.com'>Kevin Marks</a>:  <blockquote><p>so the chat room is more seminar like than the lecture?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://meta.ly'>Elisa Jo Harkness</a>:  <blockquote><p>yes - and trying to get people to structure interaction with each other in chat rooms is hard
<p>I found my peer group in railsbridge, and it is the community that makes it work
<p>there is a lot of bootstrapping and self enablement her, but also a lot of opportunism here- audience seekers
<p>going to a lecture and taking a test probably teaches you less than a seminar, even if you can't measure it 
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>'academic' can mean writing papers rather than writing things that work
<p>there is a large unfiltered mass from people who have an idea, but people who have built it say "that didn't work"
<p>if you're not willing to commit to your own website
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://meta.ly'>Elisa Jo Harkness</a>:  <blockquote><p>it is only $10/year to make a website but it feels like a bigger commitment
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='https://darius.dunlaps.net'>Darius Dunlap</a>:  <blockquote><p>how much I spend a month is nothing compared to the time I put into it
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://meta.ly'>Elisa Jo Harkness</a>:  <blockquote><p>is wordpress the middle ground between squarespace and self hosting?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='https://darius.dunlaps.net'>Darius Dunlap</a>:  <blockquote><p>wordpress was that middle ground as it made it simpler a few years ago
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>wordpress now has got more complicated so you need to manage it too
<p>Known <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/withknown">@withknown</a> is the new simplification, with thinking about mobile a key part
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://meta.ly'>Elisa Jo Harkness</a>:  <blockquote><p>where I'm frustarted when it is too easy, but then I can't customise it - I care deeply about typography
<p>i'm interested in pocket and instapaper because they take the page out of it's context
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://kevinmarks.com'>Kevin Marks</a>:  <blockquote><p>a big part of what made blogging matter was the chaotic possibilities that different layouts made possible
<p>there are more ways to express ourselves than the 3 or 4 templates we have from twitter and facebook
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://meta.ly'>Elisa Jo Harkness</a>:  <blockquote><p>I'm reading things constantly but I'm always in a battle against the open tabs.
<p>
<p>I have a set of bookmarks which I will never read but ti is nice to thinkI'll search them sometimes
<p>i feed things into <a class="auto-link" href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> when I have read them, but they only show up in my blog footer
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://kevinmarks.com'>Kevin Marks</a>:  <blockquote><p>a key thing that slack does it give a link preview for anything you post so you can grasp it, and click later
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://meta.ly'>Elisa Jo Harkness</a>:  <blockquote><p>the integrations are what is key to making Slack work, as you don't have to use the service they way they chose
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>more important than integrating with other independent sites is plugging into where your friends read
<p>keep integrating with lots of other service rather than forcing people to come to your site
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://meta.ly'>Elisa Jo Harkness</a>:  <blockquote><p>my comedy hack day site was <a class="auto-link" href="http://ifthisthen.cat/">http://ifthisthen.cat/</a> - do read the api documention
