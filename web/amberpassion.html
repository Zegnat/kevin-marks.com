<a class='h-card' href='http://caseorganic.com/'>Amber Case</a>:  <blockquote><p>I'm going to talk about the IndieWeb - the independent Web
<p>I want to demonstrate POSSE - post on your own site, syndicate elsewhere.
<p>it used to be when you shared to twitter or facebook, all comments were stuck there but <a class="auto-link" href="http://brid.gy">brid.gy</a> brings them back 
<p>I'm going to log in with my own domain name - this uses IndieAuth - it's like oAuth but indie
<p>I'm going to make a note on my site and syndicate to twitter and facebook, or even to medium
<p>here is my post on my site: <a class="auto-link" href="http://caseorganic.com/notes/2014/04/17/4/indieweb">http://caseorganic.com/notes/2014/04/17/4/indieweb</a>
<p>oh wow, look at all these people responding! The demo works.
<p>it uses my short url <a class="auto-link" href="http://anth.ro">anth.ro</a> which I had to talk to a Romanian bank to get
<p>IndieAuth works by linking form your own site to twitter github etc and back, to prove it is you
<p>this presentation is hosted on my own site, so I don't have to worry about someone deleting it
<p>Do you remember geocities? Myspace? Upcoming? posterous? Gowalla? Lavabit? did your stuff vanish?
<p>when sites die, they can be nice like posterous, and let you get your data back. Or they can be like AOL hometoen
<p>When AOL Hometown shut down they didn't email people, they put a notice on the Hometown site, which no-one went to
<p>one poor AOL hometown user posted "fortunately I saved my website to geocities"
<p>we're all sharecropping on these sites like facebook <a class="auto-link" href="http://indiewebcamp.com/sharecropping">indiewebcamp.com/sharecropping</a>
<p>here is my favourite version of twitter ( c. 2008) - when the site UI changes it's like my house being rearranged
<p>We're losing ownership up Maslow's hierarchy- we're now renting out self actualization from social networks
<p>back in 2003 people were making their own (weird, quirky) websites, and learning about the web
<p>back in 2003 we had blogs and our own domains to host our identity, and they learned to code with their blogs
<p>blog software let you adapt your site if you knew how to code, or write if you didn't
<p>the RSS and Atom wars happened, and we ended up with Friendster, facebook, myspace and twitter
<p>these social network sites unified the reading and writing experiences, because reading feeds got hard
<p>there was a thing called pingback and trackback that was machine-generated to show links - it got full of spam
<p>there is not a lot of personal blog activity - WordPress is dominant, medium has some too
<p>Medium did have some terms of service that were worrying - they could use your content forever, that got fixed
<p>now short status update are an acceptable form of content, but we need to own our own data
<p>back in 2008 <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/blaine">@blaine</a> and Ralph Meijer stayed up all night at Foo camp and got twitter talking to jaiku
<p>in 2010 at the Federeted Social Web Summit, <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/aaronpk">@aaronpk</a> and <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/t">@t</a> and I realised that standards came after working code
<p>A lot of times standards happen because somebody makes a temporary solution, and then get lost in committees
<p><a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/t">@t</a> and <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/aaronpk">@aaronpk</a> and I decided to make IndieWebCamp - show don't tell; creators only; your own domain name to come
<p>to register for IndieWebCamp, you had to have your own domain name, log in with OpenID and use mediawiki
<p>this meant we had people who came who could cope with things that were messy
<p>The problem with all the standards people is that they fight on mailing lists, so IndieWeb has no mailing lists
<p>instead of a mailing list we have IRC, so we can use the Loqi bot to send them a message for later
<p>when there is enough stuff in the IRC, someone will document it on a wiki page
<p>I asked Brad Cunningham why wikis work and he said that error pages become opportunities to fix things
<p><a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/baline">@baline</a> says when stories win over implementations, the best storyteller wins, not the best solution
<p>Principles: POSSE Publish Own Site, Share Elsewhere
<p>if POSSE isn't possible, use PESOS - Post Elsewhere, Share to Own Site - it's a bandaid
<p><a class="auto-link" href="http://Sandeep.io">Sandeep.io</a> created WebMention - if you mention a post you can tell them to look it up and show it on their site
<p>We added IndieWeb Event RSVP so we can get RSVPs back from facebook too
<p>We need an IndieWeb because you might lose photos and files, if the site shuts down, gets bought or changes ToS
<p>IndieWeb is Freedom - to decide what to post and where to share it
<p>Homestead, don't Sharecrop! - have a home for your own data, that can't be taken from you
<p>the community has built a lot of tools, many open source so you cna set these up
<p>What to do? Own your Own domain - they're cheap
<p>Join the indieweb IRC channel: <a class="auto-link" href="http://indiewebcamp.com/IRC">http://indiewebcamp.com/IRC</a>

<a class='h-card' href='http://julieannhorvath.com'>Julie Ann Horvath</a>:  <blockquote><p>putting your content in silos is like having a bunch of ex-boyfriends who won't give your stuff back
<p>we're going to take questions from the audience, I'll repeat
<p>audience q:where did you get your socks?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://caseorganic.com/'>Amber Case</a>:  <blockquote><p>they're from japan, and they feature capybaras which are awesome animals in a hottub in japan
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://julieannhorvath.com'>Julie Ann Horvath</a>:  <blockquote><p>audience q: are these technologies at the point where your grandmother could use them?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://caseorganic.com/'>Amber Case</a>:  <blockquote><p>I'm glad you asked, I prepared an answer at <a class="auto-link" href="http://indiewebcamp.com/generations">http://indiewebcamp.com/generations</a> for people who cna join in
<p>as we go through these generations of communities, we grow more people and make it more formal and easier
<p>I'm giving you a sneak peek into an immature technology that is growing slowly
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://julieannhorvath.com'>Julie Ann Horvath</a>:  <blockquote><p>audience q: how do terms of service handle pulling comments form other sites?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://caseorganic.com/'>Amber Case</a>:  <blockquote><p>it can get complicated - we are trying to get comments back from instagram at the moment, and they don't let us yet
<p>it works on most sites, but they can change the terms of service to stop you getting it back
<p>The web is a big mess - it always has been, but ToS makes it a worse mess
