<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://brian.behlendorf.com'>brianbehlendorf</a>:  <blockquote><p>Apache got fed up with w3c process a while ago. Trouble is that nobody changes their mind in public any more
<p>if you can talk with people in person you can often change their minds and then have it formally reflected
<p>I tried to implement OpenID at ostpc.gov - if you used Yahoo's OpenID you got a horrible ugly url
<p>I view the ability to have private communications between individuals as a human right - end to end encryption

<span class='h-card' >Jason Ingalls</span>: <blockquote><p>I can give them a run for their money
<p>think of security as like a block of swiss cheese - you don't want those holes to line up and make a path through
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>: <blockquote><p>I want to harden myself to a reasonable level of security, but not from state-level actors
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://iboxifoo.com/'>John Rogerson</a>:  <blockquote><p>I worry about the silos creating attractive pools of data that is worth hacking

<a class='h-card' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>we care less about use of resources than compromising our private data

<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://brian.behlendorf.com'>brianbehlendorf</a>:  <blockquote><p>one problem with indieweb is that we don't have an end to end internet any more
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>we're not trying to reinvent DNS - we assume that works and we'll use it. Lets solve other problems first
<p>the big problems are mostly UI and not plumbing - that is what holds back the indieweb. Solve UI first
<p>my whole site is set up on flat files, I don't even use a database - I don't need to remember some bizarro mysql password
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://brian.behlendorf.com'>brianbehlendorf</a>:  <blockquote><p>I love that tantek and I are fetishizing different bits of the stack - I like mail, he likes files
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>I can't trust those [email] specs because there aren't test suites for them, unlike HTTP and SSL and HTML
<p>we are trying to solve SSL certs for indieweb, but it is still hard
<p>we have instructions for ssl on various different hosting services: http://indiewebcamp.com/https

<a class='h-card' href='http://brian.behlendorf.com'>brianbehlendorf</a>:  <blockquote><p>what if most of us got our sustenance from McDonalds, Taco Bell, Subway - we'd lose something. We want kitchens
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>it's good that McDonalds are serving unhealthy food, because it gives us a reason to go indie.
