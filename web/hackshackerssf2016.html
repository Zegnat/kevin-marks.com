<p><div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://matter.vc'>Corey Ford</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>Matter is a startup accelerator focused on the future of media and journalism with a 20 week design thinking model
<p>we help startups fail fast, get feedback, iterate on their venture to get to a demo day
<p>matter's focus is on getting to a pitch that will get VC's to invest in your startup
<p>we want teams that work together well, and have a functioning prototype of their project
<p>we have a design review every month - which is a simulated demo day so you can fail fast and iterate
<p>design review 0 is a baseline - it as an ass-kicking for you to get raw feedback for you to deconstruct
<p>you need top down. bottom up, MVP, money strategy, growth strategy all wrapped in a story
<p>top down is a view of big trends and how they will play out over 2 years. this is your "In a Worldâ€¦" intro
<p>Bottom Up means you need an actual problem to solve for a customer
<p>you have to do this funky dance between the super high level view and the clear problem you're solving
<p>the top down pitch can get too abstract - when you're an entrepreneur abstraction is your enemy. start concrete
<p>the more abstract you are in the beginning, the more people make stuff up about what you are talking about
<p>never organise your business around ideas; organise around problems
<p>You need a Minimum Viable Product, but it does need a way to make money and a growth hypothesis
<p>you need to wrap it all in a story - building a venture is a multivariate challenge
<p>what I learned from making documentary films is that a big issue is unlocked by character-driven narrative
<p>a good pitch is a 3 act structure that has 2 character driven narratives in it
<p>the first character is your user and their problem; the 2nd character is your team and how they resolve the problem
<p>your job is to sell the investor on the journey that they can come on with you to the next fundable lily pad
<p>don't confuse design review with pitch practice - a pitch sums up your current project state in a story for others
<p>as an entrepreneur you are the leader of a tribe that is building over time
<p>for each design review you are putting a stake in the ground and getting feedback on it
<p>we have a series of questions for each design review:
<p>1. does your excitement outweigh your hesitation?
<p>2. do the top-down trends make this space worth pursuing? (whether this is the right product or not)
<p>3. Is there a clear bottom-up user point of view? Can you imagine a user doing this
<p>4. does the product meet that need in a compelling way? Is the user journey clear
<p>5. Is there a clear growth hypothesis?does it grow over time
<p>6. Is there a a clear path to making money? not necessarily now
<p>7. is there a strtegy for sustainable competitive advantage? Network effects
<p>8. Is the storytelling clear and compelling?
<p>9. what are the 3 critical things for this team to do next? key thing is to focus
<p>10. Is this the team to do it?  - this is the hidden question, but investors always ask it
<p>when an entrepreneur has been building something in stealth mode for 18 months, there is often an obvious flaw

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://matter.vc'>Corey Ford</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>we are not set up for that, but this process can apply to a non-profit effort too
<p>most businesses have multiple possible users, but you need to choose the most important user to focus on
<p>average team size is 3, with a range of 1 to 8 (we don't like to bet on 1) - everyone is involved in everything

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://matter.vc'>Corey Ford</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>there is always a drunken walk- you need prototyping and executing. Twitter started as a podcast company
<p>when a team has killed something precious to them in their initial pitch, they are likely doing well

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://linkedin.com/in/danolsen98'>Dan Olsen</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>Lean Startup is about making explicit hypotheses; testing those assumptions; iterating quickly
<p>I wrote the "Lean Product Playbook" to make Lean Startup clearer from a product perspective
<p>Lean Canvas is a single sheet for you to articulate your product theory on
<p>1 customer segments 2 problem 3 unique value 4 solution 5 channels 6 make money 7 costs 8 metrics 9 unfair advantage
<p>Product-Market Fit is a pyramid Market
<p>the number 1 mistake with MVP is to overbuild; the number 2 is to build a layer, not a slice
