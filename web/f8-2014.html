<p><a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@finkd'>Mark Zuckerberg</a>:  <blockquote><p>this is going to be a different kind of f8 - in the past we did it when we had a new product to make you change your apps
<p>we're here to provide a stable mobile platform to build grow and monetize your apps [bye bye 
<p>The mobile ecosystem is so siloed - the mobile platformsa are all competing #indieweb
<p>as devs we want tools that work across all these mobile platforms. FB's goal is to build the cross-platform platform
<p>all our mobile apps are built on the same platform and APIs that you use for mobile platforms [one thing twitter stopped]
<p>we used to have this famous mantra "move fast and break things" but fixing bugs was slowing us down
<p>now it's "move fast with stable infra" [translation I want to be Microsoft not Yahoo, dammit]
<p>we're introducing a 2 year API stability guarantee [he's not discontinuing Facebook XP]
<p>we're putting People First - we serve Developers, Advertisers, but themost important people are aour users
<p>People want more control over how apps use their data [read FB wants more vetos over apps using your data]
<p>we know some people are scared of pressing the "Login with Facebook" button because an app might do something bad
<p>from now on when you log into an app with facebook you can change line by line what you share with this app
<p>in the past, apps could see not just your data but data friends have shared with you. That will change
<p>for apps to see your friends info, they need to login too [making sure your app can't grow too fast for FB]
<p>We added anonymous login so you can try apps without sharing your identity right away
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://ilya.sukhar.com'>Ilya Sukhar</a>:  <blockquote><p>is doing a huge pitch for facebook as a backend
<p>there are times when you connection is really flaky and your phone falls apart, it's just a calculator
<p>we need to make it easier to build offline apps so we added Parse local data store so your queries work well offline
<p>I've been working with the URL for as long as I can remember. It's the fundamental unit of sharing #indieweb
<p>it's a shame that the URL is not really a big deal on mobile  [it is on android]
<p>All these apps on mobile are stuck in their own silos [so put them in our silo instead]
<p>when I open up links on my iPad I get stuck in a mobile web browser, why is that?
<p>the world of mobile has no unified way to discover links across platforms [it does, it's called the web]
<p>I'm announcing AppLinks an open standard with open source SDKs to discover and navigate deep links on mobile
<p>got to <a class="auto-link" href="http://applinks.org">applinks.org</a> and mark your website up to say what your app URLs are, and we crawl them
<p>The iOS and Android apps we ship now have applinks, so we can deep link into your apps from FB now
