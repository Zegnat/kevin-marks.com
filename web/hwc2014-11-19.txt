#indieweb @t: this week I got a really dumb thing working  - serving a file extensionless url from a file using Apache rewrite
#indieweb @t: people say "you're using an iPod? how is that a phone" and I send them to my contact page to understand it
#indieweb @t: user testing shows that when you add a link to your website on their homescreen, they think they're installing an app of you
#indieweb @t: Ben Roberts took the contacts idea and added a login using indieauth to give more contact modes if he knows you
#indieweb @t: Amy did a contact page with her own look, and also included her personal irc channell
#indieweb @t: handing out the prototype to non-techy people has been really useful
#indieweb @dariusdunlap: I'd like to make the contact.html idea my actual homepage
#indieweb @benwerd: trying it on android lollipop with chrome, tantek's 'add to homescreen' popup works 
#indieweb @t: this is simple, dumb and useful, but it impresses your friends
#indieweb @t: the harder thing I got worked out was how to tag people in photos or other posts in an indieweb way
#indieweb @t: if ben posts a photo of kevin on ben's site, I can post a reply that says 'in this rectangle of the image is kevinmarks'
#indieweb @t: you send a webmention to the photo post to say there is a person there, and you send a webmention to the people you tag too
#indieweb @t: the reply context for a person tag post on a photo is the entire photo - you should see the rect that is you
#indieweb @t: the point is that treating a person tag as a first class post type works with all the other flows we have
#indieweb @npdoty: one process is that you can let the person who has been tagged veto the tag, or remove it
#indieweb @t: one answer would be a vouch requirement that shows you have linked to each other before
#indieweb @benwerd: can I quarantine the webmention until it has been approved?
#indieweb @t: a rel=status link in a webmention will make this work
#indieweb @benwerd: tagging people is one of the major sources of abuse on facebook - this lets us head that off before it happens
#indieweb @kevinmarks: this would not delete the tagging assertion from the source, but would prevent it propagating to the photo 
#indieweb @t: if ben says "where's the vouch?" I then have to show that I actually know them with a link
#indieweb @t: the basic solution is that you use a p-category tag with a h-card to say it is a person - you could use a geolocation or adr
#indieweb @t: you could even use a h-event to say that the photo was time  bounded too
#indieweb @npdoty: you could use a like as an approval mechanism for these 
#indieweb @t: foursquare has the ability to check other people in  - it can say 'no, yes, auto'
#indieweb @npdoty: it's an important part of foursquare to check into palces you aren't really at
#indieweb @benwerd: I was mayor of chez panisse for a while as my soul was there
#indieweb @4c4d: I change my profile every few months
#indieweb @4c4d: I've been securing things - eg VPN my phone traffic to my home internet
#indieweb @4c4d: I'm not sure I should be running my phone traffic through comcast; I've been desiloing stuff mostly off of google
#indieweb @npdoty: I've been working on 2 things - one is citations - I went to a citations hackathon
#indieweb @npdoty: I want my academic work to be on the web wiht proper citations
#indieweb @npdoty: I forked citeproc.py which creates official citations in various formats
#indieweb @npdoty: the output of the citation usually loses the semantics; I am modifying this to create h-cite markup
#indieweb @npdoty: harassment stuff: I posted to bcc.npdoty.name on how to proactively deal with harassment
#indieweb @npdoty: if someone has to buy a new domain name every time they want to harass me that's good
#indieweb @benwerd: there are also irritating free services that hand out subdomains to people
#indieweb @npdoty: if you're doing that you should take some responsibility for your actions
#indieweb @kevinmarks: using rel=me you can get more information about a subdomain and possible twitter accounts etc
#indieweb @npdoty: the twitter thing I saw was blocktogether which collates lists of twitter accounts to block - do this for domains
#indieweb @dariusdunlap: I have somebody pretending to be me on a facebook thread with my name and avatar
#indieweb @dariusdunlap: I reported it to facebook and it was gone in a shot
#indieweb @t: twitter does not make removing cloned profiles as easy you have to give govt id
#indieweb @t: there is a question of paraody accounts -eg the new gap logo
#indieweb @t: are we trying to fight parody or preserve that?
#indieweb @kevinmarks: ICANN has a procedure for impersonating domains in place
#indieweb @dariusdunlap: slander and defamation have very long histories and legal defintions
#indieweb @benwerd: there are existing trust models that could be used as possibilities for vouch
#indieweb @dariusdunlap: what if someone uses the wrong name in a webmention
#indieweb @t: there is a service called checkmention.appspot.com that sends spoofed webmentions so you cna decide how to handle them
#indieweb @shingwong: I have shingw.com as well as syncmotion.co
#indieweb @shingwong: how would you approach presentations - that could livestream or tweet out a slide?
#indieweb @4c4d: reveal.js is a good way of doing presentations that lets you add css+js on top and could tweet too
#indieweb @kevinmarks: I use reveal.js for my slides - slides.kevinmark.com
#indieweb @t: I use shower.js pronounced as show-er
#indieweb @shingwong: I want to share that particular slide as I speak - screengrab or URL?
#indieweb @kevinmarks: slides.com lets you generate reveal.js files by hand
#indieweb @shingwong: if I'm doing presentations it would be great to be abel to tweet out a particular slide
#indieweb @dariusdunlap: if you have a short url for your own site for every slide you can do your own URL
#indieweb @kevinmarks: the problem with twitter is getting them to approve you as a card provider -you could use flickr
#indieweb @t: don't try and deal with the twitter cards markup - post an image to them. let them eat bitmaps
#indieweb @4c4d: I wonder how many twitter apps I have authorized. Oh wow, twitter for every platform
#indieweb @t: Ben, you made http://freemydata.co/ to get your data out- could you have free your tokens too?
#indieweb @benwerd: @erinjo made freemydata.co with links to how to get your data out, but they're all different
#indieweb @benwerd: being able to unmung the data from freemydata.co into microformats would be very useful
#indieweb @t: if you go to www.google.com/accounts/IssuedAuthSubTokens you can see what can see your google
#indieweb @kevinmarks: I implemented the person tagging markup in the noterlive archives - They'll show up when I post these notes
#indieweb @benwerd: I rewrote my API code to use micropub, and also rewrote my POSSE code to post to multiple accounts
#indieweb @benwerd: on my to do list is to try POSSE to webhooks so I can work with @slackhq
#indieweb @benwerd: I also did a lot of work on the reader but there is nothing to show yet
#indieweb @benwerd: I also worked on a thorough Wordpress importer which we are testing
#indieweb @benwerd: we receive homepage webmentions but don't show them yet -would notify
#indieweb @kevinmarks: I'm receiving webmentions at kevinmarks.com, and embedding them with the same app as other pages
#indieweb @t: you could tell the distinction between being mentioned and explictly tagged in a post
#indieweb @benwerd: webmentioning your homepages woudl also work well for an invitation to an event
#indieweb @dariusdunlap: it feels like this is getting close to the point where we can build things that normal people can use
#indieweb @t: if we can use them ourselves, then implementing them in bridges to silos is also easy
#indieweb @t: Aaron finally started POSSEing email like @npdoty does too
#indieweb @t: it is easy to POSSE to email because email is so insecure you can spoof as yourself
#indieweb @dariusdunlap: I have upgraded my site to A- on SSL, and I moved house
#indieweb @dariusdunlap: I now have a very fast connection to the local ISP in my new house - now 150Mbit WiFi link
#indieweb @dariusdunlap: If I can use my house as an event space for an indiewebcamp I could lift the ISP cap for a few days
