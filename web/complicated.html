<p>each chapter fo my book responds to a different panic point
<p>You can buy my book "It's Complicated" <a class="auto-link" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0300166311?ie=UTF8&camp=213733&creative=393185&creativeASIN=0300166311&linkCode=shr&tag=epeusepigone-20">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0300166311?ie=UTF8&camp=213733&creative=393185&creativeASIN=0300166311&linkCode=shr&tag=epeusepigone-20</a> but it's all up online for students too
<p>Starting in the late 1970s we began 24-7 news, and parents were shown stories that made them fear for their kids
<p>the 1980s pulled kids indoors more, which gave rise to the Latchkey Kid phenomenon
<p>as a latchkey kid you'd get home (see friends) have a healthy snack (Lucky Charms) and do homework (Watch TV)
<p>to reassure parents, instead the kids ended up in structured activities all the time, from school to bed
<p>suburbanization and school choice meant that you were more spread out - you couldn't bike to friends
<p>there was also a fear of school buses - everyone would go on the bus and hang out before and after school
<p>now school buses are down to 30% and walking has collapsed too, so most kids are driven to school by parents
<p>the places young people could hang out got curtailed; malls banned teens, and they had no part time jobs, no cash
<p>with the low wage jobs teens used to do going to older people, they are more dependent on parents for money
<p>it's also a collective action problem - even if you can get out, have money, your friends don't
<p>you used to be able to drive at 16, but now most states won't let you drive friends at that age, so no point
<p>all these changes coincided with the rise of social networks, so the teens moved their public life online
<p>young people want to be *in* public, but not *be* public - not seen by everyone
<p>I'm goign to tell you about technical and social approaches to privacy in the face of parents
<p>I met a girl in DC who would keep getting drama dredged up, so she deleted all her facebook stuff each day
<p>I asked her if people could keep it anyway, and she said yes, but that would mean they were being a freak
<p>snapchat isn't for teens to share inappropriate content - thats what 20somethings and politicians use it for
<p>teens use it where they don't care about persistence - I won't even care about that donut after 10 seconds
<p>with snapchat, teens have to pay attention, but only for 7 seconds, so they choose when to do it
<p>michaela was a word of the state, in foster care so her case worker would look at everything on line
<p>so Michaela tried to delete facebook, but they give a huge guilt trip when you try
<p>so Michaela would deactivate facebook each time she logged off, then reactivate the next day so she had control
<p>teens ahve learned to encode their content- I could make sense of myspace, but couldn't decode facebook codes
<p>teens assume surveillance is part of their world - by parents, teachers or classmates so they encode on FB
<p>schools lock down social, but not gmail, so kids use gmail during the day tho' wouldn't be seen on it at night
<p>teens would put brands all over their posts "lets hang out, Nike" so FB would promote them in the feed
<p>Big Data analysts make me laugh. Coca cola were popular on facebook, and proud. Young people meant the other Coke
<p>Teens are already living in a world where they assume surveillance, govt is just an extension of parents, schools
<p>As I look at teens engagement with technology, I see them doing what they always did in a new environment
<p>Think about the ways that you can make certain that young people are OK. Use the technology to check in
<p>Jane Jacobs was an amazing urban theorist who said we needed eyes on the street. not cops, but all of us
<p>as we've got obsessed with technology we forget the world around us, we need to put our eyes on digital streets 
<p>life stages makes a big difference to how people use the same technology
<p>for teenagers now, Facebook is not a place for them as it is full of their parents hanging out with their besties
<p>teens used to change their IDs as they matured but that got harder, so instead they change modalities
<p>we tend to pay attention to how the privileged classes use tech, but they are bifurcated here too
<p>teens look at what they can gain from tech, but those with more privilege think about what they have to lose
<p>the thing I struggle with the most is how you move a collective action problem
<p>there's a great film out called Teenage, which is about the social construction of the teenager
<p>we created compulsory highschool in the 1950s as a jail system to keep the teens out of the workforce
<p>this age segregation shaped American society - we now use "brain science" to justify teens not making decisions
<p>we're creating compulsory Higher Education now in response to another labour market crisis
<p>there is an academic fetishization of what is new and hot No more big data studies based on twitter please!
<p>I made the foolish mistake of analyzing the tensions between MySpace and Facebook in 2006
<p>the media narrative was obsessed with facebook and trashing MySpace, but used by a poorer demographic
<p>I realised we were constructing a narrative of myspace as urban and dirty and ghetto - marginalised people
