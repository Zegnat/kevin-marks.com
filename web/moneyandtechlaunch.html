<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.tradehill.com'>Jered Kenna</a>:  <blockquote><p>I ran the first US bitcoin exchange, but theres a lot of regulation it got shut down. 
<p>there's a big gap between techy forums and mainstream media, so we're in it
<p>I started out with bitcoin in 2009 - I got sent 10,000 bitcoins, which I sent to someone else who deleted them
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://howdoyoubuybitcoins.com/'>nym</a>:  <blockquote><p>we were the first outlet to accept bitcoins in our cupcake shop, because we had an iPad in the shop

<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.ripple.com'>Chris Larsen</a>:  <blockquote><p>Ripple is using the same technology that made bitcoin possible, but to build an internet for value exchange
<p>we think we're entering the age of the internet for value exchange, not just for file exchange
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.tradehill.com'>Jered Kenna</a>:  <blockquote><p>bitcoin has been relatively stable recently. Will this last?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@paigefreeman'>Paige Freeman</a>:  <blockquote><p>Bitcoin's going to go up and down, but when people ask if they should invest I say yes
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://howdoyoubuybitcoins.com/'>nym</a>:  <blockquote><p>There aren't enough onramps into the bitcoin currently - it's a highway for money that we need to get on
<p>I encourage you t sell things for bitcoin as that is an easy way to get in compared to buying them
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.ripple.com'>Chris Larsen</a>:  <blockquote><p>there is a ton of pent-up demand in this whole space - Wall Street is gearing up for it
<p>it's still too hard to get funds into these protocols because of the reputational risk for big players
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.tradehill.com'>Jered Kenna</a>:  <blockquote><p>now you have got major companies and banks interested, what's going to be the next big shift?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.ripple.com'>Chris Larsen</a>:  <blockquote><p>as these get accepted and the reputational risk goes down, it'll bridge into SWIFT and VISA and so on

<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@paigefreeman'>Paige Freeman</a>:  <blockquote><p>once more merchants accept bitcoin, that will drive the banks into it too
<p>I think airlines and travel are a natural fit for Bitcoin because of the currency exchange savings
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://howdoyoubuybitcoins.com/'>nym</a>:  <blockquote><p>of course I'm going to say pre-paid cards, but it is the last mile. I still invest in litecoin and ripple

<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@paigefreeman'>Paige Freeman</a>:  <blockquote><p>we need to help people to buy bitcoin. That is the next big thing.
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.ripple.com'>Chris Larsen</a>:  <blockquote><p>more front-end ways of getting money into the system, like coinbase are needed.
<p>Security is going to be a service too - as funds look into the space they want that
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.tradehill.com'>Jered Kenna</a>:  <blockquote><p>when we started there was no regulation - now people are talking about it. What does that imply?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://howdoyoubuybitcoins.com/'>nym</a>:  <blockquote><p>ben Bernanke writing a memo in favour of it was  a big move. So far it has been encouraging

<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.ripple.com'>Chris Larsen</a>:  <blockquote><p>we testified to the Senate and banking - explaining that it isn't anonymous helps
<p>there is goign to be more fraud, and then more regulation. If a bank steps in regulation will respond
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.tradehill.com'>Jered Kenna</a>:  <blockquote><p>I like all the things that you can do with bitcoin that don't involve money - sending message etc
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.ripple.com'>Chris Larsen</a>:  <blockquote><p>there is a lot being worked on that is super-exciting - building outside the blockchain may make more sense
<p>we're working on contracts and a scripting language within Ripple to use non-monetary tasks and utilities
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://howdoyoubuybitcoins.com/'>nym</a>:  <blockquote><p>there is an opportunity for distribution of information in different ways - notarizing documents for example
<p>you can get rid of that third-party trust and do more dynamic things with money and value
<p>I'd like to talk to anyone in the banking industry who is serious
<p>regulators are viewing bitcoin as a hybrid between gold and currency. how ill that change?
<p>as long as you aren;t working towards money laundering, regulators will be happy
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@paigefreeman'>Paige Freeman</a>:  <blockquote><p>as we're not holding onto bitcoin, but just passing ti though, we don't have so much regulation
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.ripple.com'>Chris Larsen</a>:  <blockquote><p>regulation is not logical - it depends who grabs it first, whether the fed or the SEC
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.ripple.com'>q</a>:  <blockquote><p>the biggest concern is how people can keep bitcoins safely - maybe coinbase, maybe an offline wallet?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.tradehill.com'>Jered Kenna</a>:  <blockquote><p>everybody says you should start with a new linux laptop that never touches the net. Too hard.
<p>There's a company called paperwallet that is a black box that prints out a key pair that never touched the internet.
<p>if you lose that printout you're screwed, so keep copies. as time goes by it gets scarier
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@paigefreeman'>Paige Freeman</a>:  <blockquote><p>I tell everybody to use blockchain.info, even if you use coinbase move it there. [keyloggers?]

<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://howdoyoubuybitcoins.com/'>nym</a>:  <blockquote><p>are these bringing something different from bitcoin - do they have merchants or are they a clone?
<p>ripple and litecoin have good shots because they are doing different things from bitcoin
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.ripple.com'>Chris Larsen</a>:  <blockquote><p>I think we're going to see an explosion of these currencies - as long as they get a following they can work
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href=''>q</a>:  <blockquote><p>multisignature transactions got added in 2013 - Bitgo can hold one key, you have two so you are safer 
<p>I looked at the Bitpay website and saw benefits for them and miners and speculators. What do purchasers get?
<p>in addition to the benefits for the person - what is the benefit for holding them?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@paigefreeman'>Paige Freeman</a>:  <blockquote><p>one thing is that companies that accept bitcoins will offer discounts for bitcoin, as there is for cash
<p></blockquote>

<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href=''>q</a>:  <blockquote><p>over time. more bitcoin will go out of circulation - how will you handle that?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.tradehill.com'>Jered Kenna</a>:  <blockquote><p>there are rooms full of dollar bills that aren't in circulation too. I don't see big dumping
<p>anything that spooks people cna take a lot more of a hit than one guy cashing out
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://howdoyoubuybitcoins.com/'>nym</a>:  <blockquote><p>you can predict that most won't be cashed out - with a large system you can predict that [hah ask Taleb]
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href=''>q</a>:  <blockquote><p>where does bitcoin replace where money fails?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://howdoyoubuybitcoins.com/'>nym</a>:  <blockquote><p>minimum purchase 5 dollars is one place; capital controls is another - both happen organically
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.tradehill.com'>Jered Kenna</a>:  <blockquote><p>anything that requires settlement or remittance - why does that take 3 days?
<p>sending money to Honduras should not cost 25%
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://howdoyoubuybitcoins.com/'>nym</a>:  <blockquote><p>once people realise there is a system that is cheaper it'll do to money what Craiglist did to Newspapers
<p></blockquote>
