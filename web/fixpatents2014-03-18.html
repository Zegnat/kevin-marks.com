<a class='h-card' href='http://bit.ly/innstrategies'>Peter C Pappas</a>:  <blockquote><p>I used to work for the patent office causing these problems, now I work with engine
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/about/people/daniel-nazer'>Daniel Nazer</a>:  <blockquote><p>A patent  troll typically buys patents and uses lawyers on contingency to extract money from productive companies
<p>The poor quality of patents has thrown fuel on the fire of patent trolling 
<p>There is a patent on filming a yoga class, for example 
<p>There are about 10000 patents on  basic e-commerce and they are lurking everywhere 
<p>Findthebest was sued by a troll for $50000, publicized the settlement amount, and won. Cost $300,000
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://stuffthought.com/blog/'>Adi Kamdar</a>:  <blockquote><p>Startups are between a rock and a hard place -  they can't afford litigation fees
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/about/people/daniel-nazer'>Daniel Nazer</a>:  <blockquote><p>We had a startup sued in East Texas and the preliminary phase will cost $25_50,000
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@jzieger'>Jon Zieger</a>:  <blockquote><p>Stripe is a larger startup, we do have attorneys, but we haven't had any claims to date
<p>The government granted monopoly in patents s applied to software does not promote invention or discovery 
<p>It takes money from people who do invent and give it to those who file lawsuits 
<p>In a world where technology and software is iterating in real time, patents are outmoded
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/about/people/daniel-nazer'>Daniel Nazer</a>:  <blockquote><p>60% of trolls are software patents. If you Jackie hardware it gets over 80%
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.ditto.com'>Kate Doerksen</a>:  <blockquote><p>2 or 3 years ago we looked at augmented reality, and ditto had something different 
<p>Most augmented reality patents were filed in 2001when they would grant anything 
<p>We had a patent asserted against us for "putting one thing on another thing" - compositing
<p>A few weeks later 1 800 contacts decided to sue us and bought a patent to do so
<p>You can't raise vc money if you have patent lawsuits pending against you
<p>So we went to indiegogo and raised money to fight the patents 
<p>A bug patent troll told me there was an arbitrage opportunity - he'd fight them for equity in the biz
<p>The deal was sell the company for less than money invested or do the deal with the troll, so I did it
<p>Today the uspto rejected all the claims in their patent, but this is still going on 
<p>I think the system is fundamentally flawed, and I hope my story can change things
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://stuffthought.com/blog/'>Adi Kamdar</a>:  <blockquote><p>There is the troll problem, and the software patent problem of broad vague patents 
<p>Do we need to think about the bigger problem of software patents
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://bit.ly/innstrategies'>Peter C Pappas</a>:  <blockquote><p>Software payers are the poster child for broad ambiguous patents, but buddies 
<p>Clearly many of these software and business model patches a should not have been issued they're extortion 
<p>The claims are broad and vague and the infringement is not even clear 
<p>The patent office doesn't do this in a vacuum, they rely on the courts to and they have been lax on specificity
<p>The patent reform act makes it easier to challenge new patents prospectively, but not existing bad patents
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/about/people/daniel-nazer'>Daniel Nazer</a>:  <blockquote><p>The innovation act passed the house 325 to 90. It has fee shifting and specificity of claims 
<p>Innovation act also lowers discovery cost, and helps end users get out of claims 
<p>There is a troll suing cafes and hotels for providing wifi. That's extortion 
<p>The Senate had some bills floating around that affect add storing add 
<p>There was a provision in the last law enabling overturning patents more easily, but financial only 
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://bit.ly/innstrategies'>Peter C Pappas</a>:  <blockquote><p>We need to expand patent review to get rid of these bad patents that are sold to trolls 
<p>The proceedings that the pto have just initiated are revoking lots of patents
<p>The Federal circuit chief judge is calling the pto a killing field of property rights 
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.ditto.com'>Kate Doerksen</a>:  <blockquote><p>We filed a reexamine, our litigation was stayed, we crowd sourced prior art and revoked their claims 
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@jzieger'>Jon Zieger</a>:  <blockquote><p>Patents are like the weather, bad, benign, indifferent. They are orthogonal to innovation 
<p>For most companies, a patent won't cause them to succeed. Some defense against practicing entities 
<p>There is a shortage of engineer horsepower. Should they be spending time with lawyers or coding? 
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.ditto.com'>Kate Doerksen</a>:  <blockquote><p>I'm obviously pretty negative on the topic. Before patents issue your really vulnerable even if you file 
<p>Maybe I should have raised money faster, but it's really risky 
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://bit.ly/innstrategies'>Peter C Pappas</a>:  <blockquote><p>There are industries where patents provide some value, but patent thickets impede innovation 
<p>The patent process is attacked in favor of some claims being issued 
<p>There is no advocate for the consumer, just the patent lawyer and the examiner 
<p>There is not a common lexicon in software like there is in Pharma
<p>Patient trolls have nothing to lose, it's a shakedown, they don't pay attorneys fees 
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/about/people/daniel-nazer'>Daniel Nazer</a>:  <blockquote><p>There are sins options for patenting ethically, like twitters IPA and defensive patents 
<p>If you have a personal story, call your senator. Call Diane Feinstein 
<p>There are several cases pending in the Supreme Court, one of which may strike down over abstract patents 
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://stuffthought.com/blog/'>Adi Kamdar</a>:  <blockquote><p>Soon we'll have a site <a class="auto-link" href="http://fixpatents.org">fixpatents.org</a> and <a class="auto-link" href="http://fixpatents.org">fixpatents.org</a> to help you take action 
<p>I want to turn this to you guys to fix patents 
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/about/people/daniel-nazer'>Daniel Nazer</a>:  <blockquote><p>There are provisions to force the underlying company behind the shells to join he sit 
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://stuffthought.com/blog/'>Adi Kamdar</a>:  <blockquote><p>The pto makes money when it grans patents. Does it have a perverse incentive? 
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://bit.ly/innstrategies'>Peter C Pappas</a>:  <blockquote><p>The patent office gets fees for examining and for maintenance fees, the fees may drop off 
<p>I don't think there is a financial interest in granting patents, but as Kagan says they're "patent happy'
<p>There is an element of regulatory capture, there is a presumption of validity. The system is stacked
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/about/people/daniel-nazer'>Daniel Nazer</a>:  <blockquote><p>The pto had only seen a constituency of applicants only, that is slowly changing 
<p>If the pto puts out requests for comments, and comments so it is not only IBM and Qualcomm 
<p>Wild tangent is an even stupider patent than cls - we wanted a better precedent 
<p>The wild Tangent patent is showing an ad before showing the content "on the Internet" it's clearly obvious 
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.ditto.com'>Kate Doerksen</a>:  <blockquote><p>Would we have launched outside us jurisdiction? My team is Russian. We did consider at Petersburg 
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://kevinmarks.com'>Kevin Marks</a>:  <blockquote><p>No engineer looks at the pto for ideas. Pto should search w3c, IETF, and open source first for prior art 
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://stuffthought.com/blog/'>Adi Kamdar</a>:  <blockquote><p>Let's create a process that supports science rather than history
