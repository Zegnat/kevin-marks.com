#xoxo @andymcmillan: I couldn't speak at all this morning because I was screaming at @pamplemoose so much last night
#xoxo @waxpancake: in one of the games I tried to express my love to one of the characters and accidentally farted instead
#xoxo @andymcmillan: 65% of you may not know this, but there are goats - welcome to Portland @belmontgoats
#xoxo @kevin2kelly: when you're giving a presentation, they always tell you not to say more than 3 things. I'm going to tell you 30 things
#xoxo @kevin2kelly: when i was young I found a book in the library called the Golden Book of Chemistry - it told me how to make Chlorine
#xoxo @kevin2kelly: when I was in middle school I made a rip off of Dali's painting of melted clocks, but I had a working clock in mine
#xoxo @kevin2kelly: When I travelled through asia it was like going back in time to the 15th century - in Kashmir, Srinagar - that has gone
#xoxo @kevin2kelly: I had all these slides and there was no way to make a photo book then, but eventually I did http://asiagrace.com/
#xoxo @kevin2kelly: sometimes I make useful stuff like a bed, but I tend to make weird + useless things—a robot made from a year's packaging
#xoxo @kevin2kelly: in the 60s we did things like making a geodesic dome in the desert, which is now a thing, apparently
#xoxo @kevin2kelly: Stewart Brand self-published the Whole Earth Catalog, which was all user-submitted content - it was the web in print
#xoxo @kevin2kelly: The Whole Earth Catalog took 30 people a year, Cool Tools I did with 2 of us
#xoxo @kevin2kelly: I only needed 3 copies of Cool Tools, but it got to #15 on Amazon and sold 42,000 copies
#xoxo @kevin2kelly: every new technology creates new ways to succeed - we will have more than mainstreet publishing and self publishing
#xoxo @kevin2kelly: we have mayflies whose success is measured in days and bristlecone pines who measure it in 5000 years—different success
#xoxo @kevin2kelly: there is a Cambrian explosion of technology, creating more possibilities
#xoxo @kevin2kelly: The more possibilities, the more successes are unique.
#xoxo @kevin2kelly: when everyone was a farmer, all successes looked very similar; now there are so many different twisty paths to success
#xoxo @kevin2kelly: Paul Graham's definition of a startup is one that grows very fast: startups are like pigeons. We need birds of paradise
#xoxo @kevin2kelly: The greatest failures are due to success. The Innovators Dilemma explains how new successes come from the outside 
#xoxo @kevin2kelly: Startups are in the high risk domain because they have no choice - they don't have the money for the safe domains
#xoxo @kevin2kelly: There's a trade-off between Optimization and Discovery; between Knowledge and Imagination; between Answers and Questions
#xoxo @kevin2kelly: If you had 1000 true fans who buys everything you do, you could have a living - now people are doing this
#xoxo @kevin2kelly: the next 10,000 startups will be AI in the cloud added to X, for lots of X
#xoxo @kevin2kelly: Technology allows you to define your own success
#xoxo @waxpancake: our next speaker started a product whose motto is "It's nice to be nice" because @ginatrapani is so very nice
#xoxo @ginatrapani: somebody told me I should open with a joke, but I'm opening with 9-11
#xoxo @ginatrapani: In 2001 I was working at a startup in lower manhattan, standing at spring street and hudson 
#xoxo @ginatrapani: A former coworker of mine had got a job at the World Trade Center, and he turned up shaking as his alarm hadn't gone off
#xoxo @ginatrapani: watching all those people die that day made me obsessed with time, and that it will run out on all of us
#xoxo @ginatrapani: every day a version of us dies, as each change makes a new version of us 
#xoxo @ginatrapani: I became obsessed with documenting every part of my life because it felt like it might disappear any day
#xoxo @ginatrapani: I felt like I might die doing something stupid like upgrading an operating system
#xoxo @ginatrapani: so I started Lifehacker in 2004 to optimise everything in life, from buttering your toast with a cheese slicer 
#xoxo @ginatrapani: the bit of the tagline that wasn't on Lifehacker was "optimise your life because you are going to die"
#xoxo @ginatrapani: Lifehacker was like XOXO - anti-snark, optimistic and it came from me being scared for my life
#xoxo @ginatrapani: Someday, somehow your worst moments are going to feed your best work
#xoxo @ginatrapani: Michael Barish says every relationship goes through a Good Thing, a Rut, and a Transition
#xoxo @ginatrapani: A rut isn't abad thing, it's comfortable and familiar. Ruts are sticky, it's hard to pull yourself out of them
#xoxo @ginatrapani: Even if you have a dream job like I did, you start to coast. I spent so much time saving time I had no time for myself
#xoxo @ginatrapani: Even if you have a dream job like I did, you start to coast. I spent so much time saving time I had no time for myself
#xoxo @ginatrapani: Even if you have a dream job like I did, you start to coast. I spent so much time saving time I had no time for myself
#xoxo @ginatrapani: my mother always says "a lady knows when it is time to leave the dance"
#xoxo @ginatrapani: You have to drift for a while and maybe you take some weird detours - I wrote a book about Google Wave
#xoxo @ginatrapani: I'm still obsessed with time, not so much losing time and wasting time, but making the time I spend worthwhile
#xoxo @ginatrapani: Louis CK says we have all volunteered for data entry jobs for facebook and twitter [ummm…]
#xoxo @ginatrapani: getting married and having a baby were moments in my life made better by being on twitter with you
#xoxo @ginatrapani: the time we spend on social networks can be trivial or meaningful. Twitter+Facebook analyse our data, but we should too
#xoxo @ginatrapani: my site thinkup.com tries its best to find the meaningful things that happen on social networks
#xoxo @ginatrapani: part of our job as makers is to tell the story of things we make 
#xoxo @ginatrapani: How do we build a better web? Get in touch with me! [join us at indiewebcamp.com Gina]
#xoxo @golan: most of my work is creating tools for others - I have been writing code to make art
#xoxo @golan: this is an 8 foot tall robot that is on top of an art museum that is a cross between 1984 and sesame street
#xoxo @golan: one of my projects is adaptors between all construction kits -lego, tinker toys, stickle bricks
#xoxo @golan: This is a metaphor for corporate silos - the work we have to do to make them interoperate #indieweb
#xoxo @prgarc: I'm trained as an architect, and have a long relationship with mechanical drawing machines
#xoxo @prgarc: I modified a CNC router to have pen and draw pictures of historic drawing machines
#xoxo @prgarc: I made a morphed skull illusion that shows up in reflective cylinders, and made 100s and left them around town
#xoxo @golan: we're both educators, and both interested in media technology and its history
#xoxo @golan: we have a lot of art students who think realistic drawing is great art - even though it is obsoleted by cameras
#xoxo @golan: David Hockney's book Secret Knowledge says that the old masters used optical tools like the camera lucida
#xoxo @prgarc: I bought vintage camera lucidas and started drawing things with them
#xoxo @golan: camera lucida's haven't been manufactured in 300 years so they are pricy on ebay. So we decided to make a new one
#xoxo @golan: a camera lucida is a prism on a stick. The stick is the easy part, but the prisms aren't made that size now
#xoxo @golan: we needed to make 500 prisms so we did kickstarter to find 500 people who wanted 1. We found 15,000
#xoxo @golan: a MOOC that pwned Kickstarter in order to reimagine commerce and education - we used updates to deliver art history lectures
#xoxo @golan: in this parallel universe, kickstarter backers are students and their pledges are tuition fees
#xoxo @golan: we also looked at kickstarter as a performance piece - product as provocation
#xoxo @prgarc: the 3rd way to think of this is the search for Dan Winkler, who has done a neolucida drawing every day for a year
#xoxo @prgarc: Dan Winckler is the peak of participation opposite the long tail - https://www.flickr.com/photos/danwinckler/
#xoxo @prgarc: we asked china what gooseneck lengths they had lying around; they said they'd make them to order - China doesn't have shelves
#xoxo @golan: here are the 10 men and women who worked with us for 2 weeks to make the neolucidas - 12 hours a day, 2 weeks $1.50/hr
#xoxo @golan: one of our workers made 1000 neolucidas a day. I tried and could not keep up
#xoxo @prgarc: what we learned in China is that all of our stuff is hand-made, even if it looks lie it isn't
#xoxo @golan: every thing we have - every single thing - has handprints on it of the people who made it for us in China
#xoxo @kevin2kelly: Kaia Dekker (@quince) wants moveable type for sandals so you can leave messages in your footprints
#xoxo @waxpancake: Bandcamp is a way for independent musicians to sell their music directly
#xoxo @Bandcamp: we are a distributed company - we used to use irc for everything but now we switched to slack
#xoxo @Bandcamp: even though Sean and I sit in the same office, we talk to each other through Slack 
#xoxo @Bandcamp: I realised I can go for a week without talking to people, and now I'm talking to a thousand of you
#xoxo @Bandcamp: listening to a song 10000 times whil;e an ad sells you toothpaste isn't a way to support and artist
#xoxo @Bandcamp: paying subscriptions to a large company partly owned by other large companies doesn't tends to get much money to artists
#xoxo @Bandcamp: Fans have given $81 million to artists through bandcamp, $2.9M in the last 30 days
#xoxo @Bandcamp: @zoecello published her earnings last yeat 92% came from sales and 8% from streaming
#xoxo @Bandcamp: @zoecello's sales were 34% through bandcamp, 15% Amazon and 51% iTunes last year
#xoxo @Bandcamp: back in 2007 there was a band I really liked and they left their label, and their site didn't load
#xoxo @Bandcamp: the band site din't work well and I had to get the music emailed to me by the lead singer
#xoxo @Bandcamp: The services in 2007 for musicians were essentially a sharecropping - you gave them your content and they owned it
#xoxo @Bandcamp: we raised a tiny amount of VC - stuck between the seat covers of the VC's Tesla kind of money
#xoxo @Bandcamp: we worked in the public library for the first 4 years of the startup
#xoxo @Bandcamp: we became profitable in 2012 - we were keen to be a sustainable business
#xoxo @Bandcamp: If I was hoping for musicians to sustain themselves from my service I needed to do that myself too
#xoxo @Bandcamp: Thom Yorke called subscription streaming the last sad fart of a dying corpse
#xoxo @Bandcamp: as user numbers go up for subscription streaming services, losses grow higher too
#xoxo @Bandcamp: shifting all our music consumption to subscription based streaming loses something important - the record collection
#xoxo @Bandcamp: I used to browse my friends CD collections and discover music from them
#xoxo @Bandcamp: Everyone having everything looks a lot like everyone having nothing
#xoxo @Bandcamp: your kids are never going to look through your summer 2014 playlist
#xoxo @Bandcamp: Streaming services can be good for discovery but the best way to support a musician is to directly give them money
#xoxo @Bandcamp: a collection of tracks that people spend money on is important
#xoxo @Bandcamp: there have been 11 million transactions on Bandcamp
#xoxo @Bandcamp: fans pay more than the artist's asking price 50% of the time, and have given up to 100x
#xoxo @Bandcamp: about half of the notes left for artists are saying they are sorry not to be able to give more
#xoxo @Bandcamp: I saw @dickc at a conference, described bandcamp to him and he backed away while I was talking and turned to someone else
#xoxo @Bandcamp: People want to support the artists they love, but they don't know what to do to do so
#xoxo @waxpancake: Rachel Binx is a data visualiser from Brooklyn New york
#xoxo @rachelbinx: thank you for having me at 'cho-cho' - I'm using the Basque X there
#xoxo @rachelbinx: My day job is data visualisation, but you may know me from meshyou - turning places into 3d dobjects
#xoxo @rachelbinx: we originally though of it as a data visualisation project - location traces from @foursquare
#xoxo @rachelbinx: the other idea is gifpop - lenticular printing of animated gifs
#xoxo @rachelbinx: there is a lot of amazing work being done in the gif medium these days
#xoxo @rachelbinx: when you give to the internet, the internet gives back
#xoxo @rachelbinx: we like making physical things out of stuff on the internet
#xoxo @rachelbinx: normally at this point I'd show you a photo of me coding as a child, but that isn't true I learned to code 5 years ago
#xoxo @rachelbinx: I made earrings from bottle tops and tried to sell them as a hip local artist and made maybe $25
#xoxo @rachelbinx: I learned that earnestness isn't enough- you have to understand the business
#xoxo @rachelbinx: I took photos for a friend, and he cropped of the watermarks, put them up and never spoke again
#xoxo @rachelbinx: This happens too often. "Fuck you, pay me" isn't just a cute use of profanity, it matters.
#xoxo @rachelbinx: I went to Stamem and got to go to conferences and say "yes I do both design and code" (picture of unicorn)
#xoxo @rachelbinx: if you're like me, interests turn into fascinations and then into projects. My success is from a refusal to focus
#xoxo @rachelbinx: the projects are drawing connections between different interests so that you can show them to people
#xoxo @rachelbinx: I wrote a slide saying "Life pro tip: do everything all the time" - I'm getting into vague life advice 
#xoxo @rachelbinx: when it works its great to be a freelancer, but when it sucks it really sucks
#xoxo @rachelbinx: I had my first public failure last year - I tried to start a conference called ThingConf for small biz
#xoxo @rachelbinx: I thought "great, now I can write a medium post on failure"
#xoxo @rachelbinx: failing on the internet is like crying in public
#xoxo @rachelbinx: this is a screenshot of my net income in 2013 - it's nicely symmetric negative income
#xoxo @songadaymann: our next speaker has recorded a song every day for over 2000 days so far - Jonathan Mann
#xoxo @songadaymann: my grandma and I were really close, and she passed away about a year ago.
#xoxo @songadaymann: everyone else in my family is normal, but only my grandma is a weirdo like me
#xoxo @songadaymann: my grandma got her masters in Psychology in 1946 and worked as a psychoanalyst in NY until 1966 when my grandpa died
#xoxo @songadaymann: my grandma moved to Big Sur in 1966 and joined the Esalen Institute and became a hippie and travelled the world
#xoxo @songadaymann: my grandma loved to dance - she would dance all the time; she danced at a classical music concert in an NY park
#xoxo @songadaymann: Song a Day started with this thing called Fun A Day—make one piece of art for every day in January 2009. I didn't stop
#xoxo @songadaymann: I have now written 2,082 songs, one a day. I realised that I felt good when I made something
#xoxo @songadaymann: a lot of days my favourite songs come out when I feel have nothing, and then it appears
#xoxo @songadaymann: lets visit some more of my viraly viral things
#xoxo @songadaymann: song #77 I wrote about Paul Krugman - it was on Huffington Post and got to play it on Rachel Maddow
#xoxo @songadaymann: I did a jingle for Bing and won $500. @parislemon said it was terrible, so I made a song about him. 
#xoxo @songadaymann: I wrote a song called "if you don't want an iPhone 4 don't buy it"
#xoxo @songadaymann: Apple rang me up. I don't know how they got my number, but they are Apple…
#xoxo @songadaymann: Steve Jobs walked out into the antennagate press conference to my song. 
#xoxo @songadaymann: My ex and I posted a song about us breaking up, which went crazy viral 
#xoxo @songadaymann: I wrote a song about needing a roommate
#xoxo @songadaymann: I set Ruth Bader Ginsberg's dissent in the Hobby Lobby case to music
#xoxo @songadaymann: some days there is a huge viral wave, but most days it's like a quiet day fishing - I catch a song, and put it back
#xoxo @songadaymann: sometimes it feels like the gaping maw of the internet is there and I have to keep feeding it songs
#xoxo @songadaymann: sometimes I'll post a song that's a whatever song to me, and someone says "this is just what I needed today"
#xoxo @songadaymann: Day 355 I got food poisoning, and it was 3am and I hadn't made a song, so I got in the bath and sang
#xoxo @songadaymann: Day 355 I got food poisoning, and it was 3am and I hadn't made a song, so I got in the bath and sang
#xoxo @songadaymann: I've contemplated stopping; my 2000th song was around the day my son was born, but I wrote another song
#xoxo @songadaymann: on the day that my grandma died I wrote a song
#xoxo @songadaymann: My grandma had her casket made about 10 years before she died and kept it on her lawn. She would lie in it.
#xoxo @songadaymann: I had written grandma a song for her birthday every year, so I wrote another one when she was in the hospice
#xoxo @waxpancake: Some of the content of this next talk is very disturbing. I've been trying to get Anita for 2 years
#xoxo @waxpancake: Anita wades through so much abuse daily - there were even threats  to her for coming here
#xoxo @waxpancake: Anita wades through so much abuse daily - there were even threats  to her for coming here
#xoxo @femfreq: I run an educational nonprofit called Feminist frequency, and host a series of essays on women in video games
#xoxo @femfreq: the video game industry is going through a huge change - women are making more game
#xoxo @femfreq: although the industry used to mainly cater to young men, and that is changing for good
#xoxo @femfreq: I have been made a folk demon by angry men as responsible for the change in the industry
#xoxo @femfreq: somehow they think that attacking me will stop the changes happening in the gaming industry
#xoxo @femfreq: I have had a campaign of threats of rape and murder and graphic pornography 
#xoxo @femfreq: I want to cover some more subtle ways I get harrassed
#xoxo @femfreq: impersonation is a tactic to attack me - fake accounts saying I was buying $1000 shoes - stereotypic misogyny
#xoxo @femfreq: a fake quote attributing me saying Mirrors Edge controls were too hard for women
#xoxo @femfreq: fake quotes become part of an information cascade - creating justification for further and extreme abuse
#xoxo @femfreq: There are also a series of conspiracy theories about me that are delusional
#xoxo @femfreq: "Anita bleached her skin to appear more white"
#xoxo @femfreq: there is one man on youtube who has made hundreds of rants about me, some over 4 hours long
#xoxo @femfreq: I am supposed to have used neurolingusitic programming to brainwash people
#xoxo @femfreq: there are no blipvets in my videos that change people's brains, though my rhetoric can do that
#xoxo @femfreq: 4channers like to impersonate me to troll each other into further abuse. I've never posted there. You shouldn't either
#xoxo @femfreq: when I posted some of the death threats I received, I was accused of faking them by people making more threats 
#xoxo @femfreq: these conspiracy theories and hoaxes build on themselves with each new harassment
#xoxo @femfreq: the paranoia about feminists taking over video games is fueled by a deep distrust of women
#xoxo @femfreq: when women receive harassment and abuse we are blamed for it, 
#xoxo @femfreq: one of the most radical things you can do is actually believe women when they tell you about their experiences
#xoxo @waxpancake: John Gruber wrote about Apple when they were still an underdog
#xoxo @gruber: I assume that most of you have heard of Daring Fireball [lots of hands up] I also made Markdown in 2004 [cheers]
#xoxo @gruber: I write about design, technology, sometimes I try to be funny, but what I write about most and best, is about Apple
#xoxo @gruber: I wrote about Apple Computer - they're not even called that any more, they're Apple, Inc - a watch company
#xoxo @gruber: it is probable that Apple made more profit over this weekend than they did in all of 2006
#xoxo @gruber: the landscape of the independent web has changed since 2002
#xoxo @gruber: I thought I was too late when I started blogging in 2002 - there were so many great blogs then
#xoxo @gruber: Andy Baio, Dooce, Zeldman, textism were influences on Daring Fireball. Jason Kottke started his blog in 1978
#xoxo @gruber: It wasn't too late in 2002. It's never too late. There was such a great chasm between the independent web and commercial web
#xoxo @gruber: big commercial sites had big ugly CMS's that generated really ugly code.
#xoxo @gruber: sites made by individuals writing under their own name had great source code that loaded fast #indieweb
#xoxo @gruber: we had this opportunity - we were delivering higher quality work - higher production quality output
#xoxo @gruber: it was nicer to read kottke.org than  the professional publications
#xoxo @gruber: Anyone remember MacWeek? it was printed on big glossy paper and the size of the Daily news. I loved MacWeek
#xoxo @gruber: you could not buy MacWeek - you had to fill out a form like a job applications to get a copy. I lied 3 or 4 times
#xoxo @gruber: I think what gave me up was that the address was always a dorm room.
#xoxo @gruber: How could one person on his own even vaguely compete with MacWeek?
#xoxo @gruber: Samuel Johnson said "No man but a blockhead ever wrote, except for money" - the web turned that on its head
#xoxo @gruber: right from the get-go when I started Daring Fireball, I wanted to figure out a way to make it my full time work
#xoxo @gruber: in 2004 I started tinkering to see what sticks - I tried adsense when it came out. 
#xoxo @gruber: I had one good month with adsense - I made an analogy with mens hairpieces and graphic design
#xoxo @gruber: mens hairpieces look bad because they say "i'm paying lots fo money, I want more hair" - just like graphic design
#xoxo @gruber: I started selling t-shirts for $29 and memberships for $19 - the t-shirt let me help them part with the money
#xoxo @gruber: at the time I had an RSS feed that was excerpt only - the shitty kind of RSS feed
#xoxo @gruber: I use an ad network called The Deck - they don't work on RSS feeds, just on the web.
#xoxo @gruber: I made the full content feed a bonus for the members. I made a 10 char random string for each user's url
#xoxo @gruber: I said "please don't share the full content URL" - it mostly worked people din't seem to share it
#xoxo @gruber: circa 2006 people started using online aggregators like bloglines and when you searched for daring fireball you got them
#xoxo @gruber: Bloglines made a sane assumption that the URLs were public, and it looked like I was bad at designing URLs
#xoxo @gruber: Daring Fireball was a really nice hobby, but it was nowhere near my fulltime salary. 
#xoxo @gruber: I realised I had to put the fulltime effort in to get the revenue for the fulltime money
#xoxo @gruber: I announced on the site in public that I was going full time, I told people this was the time to sign up, and got $30-40k
#xoxo @gruber: by the end of 2006 income crept up until it got to about our outgoings, and then it stuck
#xoxo @gruber: in 2007 one company made a decision that made daring fireball a success -Google - they made Google Reader
#xoxo @gruber: Google reader did not grasp password authenticated feeds, which I had switched to 
#xoxo @gruber: I got daily letters asking how to get password authenticated feeds in Google Reader
#xoxo @gruber: I realised that with password authenticated feeds Google Reader would have to fetch each one individually
#xoxo @gruber: so to make Daring Fireball work in Google Reader I made the feed free. Putting ads in would be worthless
#xoxo @gruber: so instead of adsense I sold my own ads as sponsored feeds - a post thanking them once a week
#xoxo @gruber: I raised the price steadily over the years, and thanks to Google Reader I finally found a business model that worked
#xoxo @gruber: the readers lie ethe sponsors - I reject ones that don't fit my audience
#xoxo @gruber: there is a villain in this story and it is CPM - Cost Per iMpression -they can't even make the acronym right
#xoxo @gruber: the problem with CPM is that there is no way to value one form of content over another
#xoxo @gruber: I put a long article in sometimes, and I put it in the page and you can scroll down, because browsers work like that
#xoxo @gruber: a 2000 word piece is one impression, so is a cat gif 
#xoxo @gruber: breaking long essays into pages has a "click for next page" link which my dyslexia reads as "close this tab"
#xoxo @gruber: this CPM driven pagination is disrespectful - it messes up the work. And it hasn't even worked
#xoxo @gruber: I thought that web publications would figure out something better than CPM like I did, but instead they made CPM work
#xoxo @gruber: things like buzzfeed and words like "listicle" make CPM work but at the cost of the web itself
#xoxo @gruber: I know what I'm going to do in the future. I'm going to write Daring Fireball until I fucking die
#xoxo @gruber: I thought that when I burst through and Heather Armstong did and Kottke did, more would join us
#xoxo @gruber: when I started having a web design background was important, but then anyone could do it
#xoxo @gruber: I hoped that each writer, under their own name, with their own site could work, but it hasn't really happened #indieweb
#xoxo @gruber: the crowd sourcing things are starting to work - kickstarter doesn't work for ongoing things but Patreon does
#xoxo @gruber: selling one ad a week and making it a scarce resource is a better idea than the CPM nonsense.
#xoxo @gruber: Know when to be stubborn. I never considered CPM, or selling the site.
#xoxo @gruber: Know when to be flexible - I gave up the paid feed thing that I was attached to 
#xoxo @gruber: Prioritize quality over money. Apple's first priority is quality products; the 2nd priority is make enough money from them
#xoxo @gruber: Priority order matters. You can often make more money by valuing what you make more.
#xoxo @gruber: I just realised I spent 45 minutes paraphrasing the great philosopher king Kenny Rogers - Know when to hold 'em…
#xoxo @songadaymann: "you gotta know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em, know when to walk away, know when to run"
