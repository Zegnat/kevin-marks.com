#indieweb @t: welcome to the 2 year anniversary of Homebrew Website Club
#indieweb @benwerd: this is withknown.com as you have seen it before - but this has a new tab called community
#indieweb @benwerd: community has content from everyone's domain on campus, it obeys permissions
#indieweb @benwerd: people at an institution are automatically subscribed to the personal domains of everyone in the community
#indieweb @benwerd: this is decentralised aggregation with a search engine on campus - there is an institutional aggregator
#indieweb @benwerd: there is also a public portal of all public posts and a directory of users
#indieweb @benwerd: we are going to build the community tab into every known site so I can follow you, even though I use woodwind
#indieweb @benwerd: It's all indieweb under the hood, but it has a bit of a search engine for each community
#indieweb @benwerd: we will get all the institutional search engines to speak to each other as hubs
#indieweb @benwerd: we heard "I don't care about owning my website, but I want to own my data and find my friends"
#indieweb @t: another thing we have got working recently is the idea of person tagging not just to our sites but to silos
#indieweb @t: we had person-tagging between indieweb sites, now we have Ryan and Kyle to demo
#indieweb @schnarfed: Ben we're going to tag you, so check your facebook notifications 
#indieweb @schnarfed: SWAT0 is a test of interactions across services tagging photos
#indieweb @schnarfed: I took a picture of the crowd, I'm going to tag ben in it on my own site, and syndciating to facebook too
#indieweb @schnarfed: here's my post on my site https://snarfed.org/2015-11-18_16147 and here it is on facebook https://www.facebook.com/1407574399567467/posts/1520984081559831
#indieweb @kylewmahan: I added person tagging on posts on my site too - here's a pic of ben https://kylewm.com/2015/11/ben-demoing-known-at-homebrew-website-club
#indieweb @kylewmahan: I can then POSSE to flickr with brid.gy publish and it puts in the person tag https://www.flickr.com/photos/kindofblue115/23116567772/in/dateposted/
#indieweb @schnarfed: from my site I post https://snarfed.org/2015-11-18_hwc_2 and POSSE to https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10101978203975173&set=a.10101398400286413.1073741826.212038&type=3
#indieweb @schnarfed: kyle commented on his site, ben commented in facebook and they got sent back to me
#indieweb @schnarfed: I wanted to say thank you to tantek, kevin Kyle, aaron  and ben - so I made you plaques
#indieweb @benwerd: you mentioned Known, but Kyle and Ryan are running brid.gy which we all use every day
#indieweb @benwerd: Brid.gy by Kyle and Ryan is the lifeblood of this community
#indieweb @t: Brid.gy's github discussions are some of the most polite humane and considered in open source
#indieweb @kevinmarks: demo of hovercards dynamically built rather than statically
#indieweb @schnarfed: on brid.gy we have 2500 users and have handled 2.5 million events
#indieweb @schnarfed: we send webmentions, but if you don't have webmentions we will send them to your blog as comments
#indieweb @schnarfed: we now support flickr too - likes and comments come bak to your site, and also publish with person tags
#indieweb @schnarfed: we looked for more stuff to send back to your site - we now send links from twitter as well
#indieweb @schnarfed: we also have pagination and retry for webmentions on your site
#indieweb @schnarfed: for every kind of thing on facebook there are 5 or 10 urls, we handle all of those now
#indieweb @schnarfed: we pay attention to semantics more carefully now about what is a like and what is a mention
#indieweb @schnarfed: we are also telling the differnence between syndicatiion and reposting 
#indieweb @andigalpern: my site is andigalpern.com and https://cascadesf.com -we get a lot of traction wiht person-tagged photos
#indieweb @andigalpern: what I want to do is team up with a dev and upload to one place and have it create albums on facebook and my site
#indieweb @andigalpern: So this would be a good project for indiewebcamp in december
#indieweb @andigalpern: I am keen to explore new UI for galleries
#indieweb @t: indiewebcamp SF is here at Mozilla SF on December 3rd - tell your friends
#indieweb @t: here's the facebook copy of the photo that ryan posted on FBV, and I can tag kyle in it -will that go back to ryan's post?
#indieweb @schnarfed: we have a issue for this, we're probably going to get it working this weekend.
#indieweb @schnarfed: have we designed co-ordinates yet?
#indieweb @t: we have a draft with the area tag, but we couldn't get it working with micropub
#indieweb @schnarfed: facebook can tell you who tagged the person in the api, but flickr can't tell you who
#indieweb @dariusdunlap: on my site this looks very different - I can style it
#indieweb @kylewmahan: getting the tense of verbs right matters here
#indieweb @schnarfed: one of the great things about indieweb si that we each choose how to present these on our sites and can try other ways
#indieweb @t: I improved my photo posts - they automatically POSSE to both facebook and twitter using brid.gy
#indieweb @t: I think my version looks nicer than twitter's here and both twitter and facebook have the emoji combining wrong
#indieweb @t: I got implied linked image syntax - I auto embed an image URL - if the next thing is another URL I link the image to it
#indieweb @t: it bugged me that on other sites the url was showing up, and this now looks better
#indieweb @guice: I am planning our wedding, and we want to accept RSVPs through our website - so I embedded a google form
#indieweb @guice: I made the decorative images on the wedding invitation respond to the width of the site
#indieweb @bengo: my site bengo.is down at the moment. 
#indieweb @bengo: I work at livefyre, and I have been working to make our comments more indie friendly by having an OAuth 2 api
#indieweb @bengo: I have implemented OpenID Connect login for Livefyre so I can auth against this
#indieweb @bengo: all the comments I have left are locked in to our site - next quarter I want to add comment api hooks
#indieweb @dariusdunlap: I'm going to redesign my square peg foundation site and want to bring in indieweb styles
#indieweb @kevinmarks: Emoji reactions are very big on twitter: in the billions, so it is worth us understanding them http://www.kevinmarks.com/notinourstars.html
#indieweb @t: I am also working on adding person tagging to my site and want to type them in as plaintext
#indieweb @t: I want this to work on twitter names and indie domains
#indieweb @t: TV news will cite as facebook/[username] and @[username] for twitter
#indieweb @t: In indiewebcamp.com/person-tag I took the TV version and put a #  in front to tag them eg #@t #tantek.com
