<p><div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik️</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>welcome to Homebrew Website Club - we just finished Indiewebcamp NYC last weekend- we extended it from friday to sunday
<p>David Shanske recorded al the sessions for us - that's GWG on irc
<p>we had a number of folks that didn't have a website and were non-technical, all 4 were set up with a domain and site
<p>we were told that we used so much jargon that it is like learning a foreign language, so we worked on that
<p><a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/tommorris">@tommorris</a> created a really simple beginning of my webpage on github: <a class="auto-link" href="https://github.com/indieweb/blank-gh-site">https://github.com/indieweb/blank-gh-site</a> that people can fork
<p>if you go to <a class="auto-link" href="http://emmahodge.org">emmahodge.org</a> you can see someone who used tom's template to get her own name as a domain
<p>sometimes something really small that is less than a page of code can really help someone understand
<p>Webmention being published as a w3c draft got a lot of attention on hacker news, which is the usual: <a class="auto-link" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10943261">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10943261</a>
<p>I had a problem with my iPod touch losing wifi, and the only answer was to wipe and reinstall, which would lose my data
<p>github has been down all afternoon. Which is ironic as it is 2 days since Google Code shut down- they broke all URLs
<p>note that while <a class="auto-link" href="http://github.com">github.com</a> was down, <a class="auto-link" href="http://github.io">github.io</a> static sites were still up
<p>Indiewebcamp MIT is on Gregorian Pi day - March 14th - so sign up if you are nearby <a class="auto-link" href="http://indiewebcamp.com/2016/MIT">http://indiewebcamp.com/2016/MIT</a>

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://werd.io/'>Ben Werdmüller</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I'm ben though I look like evil tantek tonight - I run <a class="auto-link" href="http://withknown.com">withknown.com</a> which is an indieweb startup
<p>I'd like to introduce you to Joshua - I built my own Siri
<p>this uses a web API for speech to text - it puts it through some stanford NLP technology, and looks for signatures
<p>Siri is a black box, Google Now is a black box, wouldn't it be fun if we could plug our own data into them
<p>Joshua, is it safe to leave Mozilla? "yes, there isn't a Giants game on"
<p>The same engine can be attached to slack or whatever, but this runs in a web browser, it's not in a device
<p>if someone wants to write a better joke API for it, please do it
<p>the technology exists to parse text from speech  - we need a way to make it ours too

<p>I could make it post for me and tweet for me - or ask it "where should I be?"

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik️</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I have had hashtags on my site for a while, but they only got linked on the POSSE copies to twitter and facebook
<p>so now I markup hashtags with a category automatically on my site so when I POSSE to flickr they go through
<p>I have been POSSEing manually to flickr with <a class="auto-link" href="http://brid.gy">brid.gy</a> - because I added this, flickr has my tags <a class="auto-link" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tantek/24345146530/in/dateposted/">https://www.flickr.com/photos/tantek/24345146530/in/dateposted/</a>
<p>I took a photo at Indiewebcamp NYC - and tagged people. and <a class="auto-link" href="http://brid.gy">brid.gy</a> copied across the people who gave permission

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.wordyard.com'>Scott Rosenberg</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>my site is <a class="auto-link" href="http://www.wordyard.com">http://www.wordyard.com</a> which is a wordpress site
<p>So <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/libertymadison">@libertymadison</a>, <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/kevinmarks">@kevinmarks</a> and I were at Hacks Hackers Connect #HHConnect this weekend and I started a group
<p>So I was frustrated with having to cross-post links and posts from my wordpress to lots of other sites, 
<p>so I proposed a write once, post many places tool - and I understand that <a class="auto-link" href="http://withknown.com">withknown.com</a> does a lot of this
<p>we brainstormed ideas on what would help with the problem of cross-posting longform content
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://werd.io/'>Ben Werdmüller</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>so this was Lean Product Canvas?
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.wordyard.com'>Scott Rosenberg</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I had all sorts of quibbles and arguments with the nomenclature - why would the advantage be unfair?
<p>so the idea would be to create an ideal post with title, image content etc, and then see previews of it in each silo
<p>so on twitter, if your summary is over 140 you would truncate it
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://werd.io/'>Ben Werdmüller</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>on twitter, you may need to publish it somewhere else first
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://kevinmarks.com'>Kevin Marks</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>the challenge I see is the longer form posts that have substructure
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://Youtube.com/LibertyMadisonTV'>#ThatTechGirl</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>so we liked the idea of being able to make sense of the post and use AI to map it to what the platform wants
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.wordyard.com'>Scott Rosenberg</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I was trying to keep it minimal, so when I hear AI I am a bit wary
<p>If we're doing the publish once, syndicate everywhere, I want the post to be in those places honoring their differences
<p>it's still hard to do that
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://werd.io/'>Ben Werdmüller</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>the meme with, say, AMP is that the content comes to you - it gets imported by whichever system
<p>you may have designed it for google search results, but <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/nuzzel">@nuzzel</a> sees the same thing

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://kevinmarks.com'>Kevin Marks</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>vine needs 6 seconds, instagram 15 seconds, flickr 120 seconds - video is harder

<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.wordyard.com'>Scott Rosenberg</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>this was heavily publisher and journalist oriented - a lot of people are doing this within their employers systems
<p>part of being a journalist now is to crosspost your work to tumblr and twiitter and so on
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://werd.io/'>Ben Werdmüller</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>the criticism I have always got is that people need to re-edit for different destinations
<p>the trick is thta people
<p>people's definition of viable varies - what people expect for audiences is tricky
<p>I ma stubborn and I think of overlapping audiences, but each site does have

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://kevinmarks.com'>Kevin Marks</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>my take is that we can add substructure to posts that makes sense elsewhere

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://notes.whatthefuck.computer/'>Zeta with Zaku Head</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>my domain is whatthefuck.computer which gets me more comment on the domain than the content
<p>it also ends up as my indiewebcamp wiki username, which is a shame
<p>my site is made from a bunch of emacs LISP that makes html pages
<p>I built my own static site engine and started using indieweb stuff to get comments on my blog to automate with <a class="auto-link" href="http://brid.gy">brid.gy</a>
<p>I connect the matrix chat system to the indieweb here http://whatthefuck.computer/blog/2015/12/19/matrix-and-indieweb/
<p>matrix at <a class="auto-link" href="http://matrix.org">matrix.org</a> is a modern IRC, a json http API, but the rooms don't live in the same place
<p>as long as someone is in the room on matrix it persists
