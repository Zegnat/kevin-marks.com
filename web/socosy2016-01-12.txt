#socosy2016 @katecrawford: there is a huge growth of listening machines, from siri to cortana to google now
#socosy2016 @katecrawford: I focus on the social and ethical implications of large data systems, and I find listening machines fascinating
#socosy2016 @katecrawford: in 1650 the Jesuit Kirscher built the talking statue - a large shell in the wall that listens to the piazza
#socosy2016 @katecrawford: the talking statue was designed as a kind of elite magic - only the elites knew it could exist
#socosy2016 @katecrawford: listening machines have always been about power, about class and invisibility
#socosy2016 @katecrawford: whats different now is that listening machines are becoming ubiquitous and have personalities
#socosy2016 @katecrawford: all this recorded audio can provide a kind of time travel where you can go back through all people in your house
#socosy2016 @katecrawford: Hello Barbie's guts are controlled by toytalk - they listen to children's questions and come up with new answers
#socosy2016 @katecrawford: So Hello Barbie is the reverse of the talking statue - it listens in your house and sends it out to the public
#socosy2016 @katecrawford: how we handle frendship requires forgetting - with perfect archives we can't do this
#socosy2016 @timhwang: when does our interest in moderation conflict with our interest in privacy?
#socosy2016 @timhwang: this is basic panopticon design 101 - it serves notice that you are being watched
#socosy2016 @timhwang: so what is different from Leviathan? a platform implemented in code, and at a huge new scale
#socosy2016 @timhwang: code moderations implies persistent identities and persistent record of action for the code to run
#socosy2016 @timhwang: platforms have perverse incentives to maximise the EMO threshold - Engagement Maximising Outrage
#socosy2016 @timhwang: platforms see themselves as platforms as passive infrastructure - CDA 230 encourages hands-off on this
#socosy2016 @timhwang: the centre of gravity of commercial entities is that they will moderate less than we'd like them to 
#socosy2016 @timhwang: we could call for fragmentation - to have a variety of platforms that make different privacy/moderation tradeoffs
#socosy2016 @katecrawford: the listening machine has now become a key driver for AI - Gate's machines that listen, see and understand
#socosy2016 @katecrawford: understanding is still hard, but we are getting better at machines that can see and hear
#socosy2016 @timhwang: a lot of deep learning and AI systems are very data-hungry processes - they need a lot to fulfil the promise
#socosy2016 @timhwang: I use listening to mean data collection, but it also implies comprehension—that's not up to human moderator standard
#socosy2016 @timhwang: the scale of these platforms make certain moderation systems difficult 
#socosy2016 @neuraltheory: my wife and I developed a system for U Phoenix and found it had to happen within 11 minutes to be effective
#socosy2016 @neuraltheory: AI really ought to be Augmented Intelligence,  not Artificial Intelligence
#socosy2016 @neuraltheory: what we need is to signal to people thta they ned to intervene, but to respond fast they need to get the context
#socosy2016 @neuraltheory: there is a strong interest in protecting the privacy of people being harassed, but not the harassers
#socosy2016 q: What is the social contract? Is there something that we have defined as a society to protect people?
#socosy2016 @timhwang: it becomes difficult to do this because of the perverse economics of scale
#socosy2016 @timhwang: the ability of users to switch to another platform may not be enough to force the platforms to the table
#socosy2016 @neuraltheory: education should be about producing happy, healthy impactful lives - explicitly, measurably and soley
#socosy2016 @neuraltheory: we listened to 10,000 undergrads and 20,000 MBAs writings on the coursework discussion
#socosy2016 @neuraltheory: we designed a system that learned economics and biology by reading the students' writing, then predicted grades
#socosy2016 @neuraltheory: we were able to predict everyone's final score within 2% based on their writing on the discussion site
#socosy2016 @neuraltheory: a bachelors' degree in CS from Stanford was only a very modest predictor of your skill as a programmer
#socosy2016 @neuraltheory: we saw the same patterns of behaviour with skateboarders and with CEOs 
#socosy2016 @neuraltheory: cognitive ability and endogenous motivation were predictive of success
#socosy2016 @neuraltheory: endogenously motivated people vastly outperform exogenously people, yet we structure classrooms exogenously
#socosy2016 @neuraltheory: most sales for salespeople happen at end of cycle, but those who sell the 1st day of the cycle do better overall
#socosy2016 @neuraltheory:  we monitored preschoolers to predict their life outcomes - we put 3 mics in the classroom to detect speakers
#socosy2016 @neuraltheory: however it is a cursed crystal ball - when you give people predictions of outcomes it reinforces the bad ones
#socosy2016 @neuraltheory: the people who need this reinforcement the most are the least likely to act on it
#socosy2016 @katecrawford: the idea of predicting life outcomes worries me - attaching children to predictions change how teachers behave
#socosy2016 @katecrawford: if I say "you're child is going to win a nobel prize" it makes it less likely to happen 
#socosy2016 @neuraltheory: the things I am talking about ought to scare people
#socosy2016 @neuraltheory: people can change direction - I know I did; I don't want predictions to come true, but to change them
#socosy2016 @judithd: what if you didn't do the surveillance of kids and sent universally applicable messages to parents instead?
#socosy2016 @geomblog: I am a computer scientist and I study algorithms. sometimes they learn patterns
#socosy2016 @geomblog: the same algorithm that tells me I should buy the new star wars box set, could be used to deny me a loan
#socosy2016 @geomblog: Algorithms make mistakes, and make mistakes that are hard to discover in high dimensional spaces
#socosy2016 @geomblog: when a camera thinks that you have blinked, but you are asian and that is how your eyes look
#socosy2016 @geomblog: when google decides that your name implies that you need ads for bail bonds, that is a problem
#socosy2016 @geomblog: a machine learning algorithm is a recipe for making recipes, which means you can't know how it made its decision
#socosy2016 @geomblog: you can't inspect and debug learned algorithms as they don't justify their parameters
#socosy2016 @geomblog: can we detect if algorithms discriminate against minority groups? Have the been trained on unfair data?
#socosy2016 @geomblog: can we express fairness and justice in such a way that algorithms can learn to be fair?
#socosy2016 @geomblog: we want algorithms to be reasonable and logical like Spock, but overuled by the emotional Kirk
#socosy2016 @geomblog: now algorithms are like 2-year-olds; the're inscrutable and you don't want them to have control, but they may grow up
#socosy2016 @geomblog: even if you have a good algorithm the training data and the evaluation metrics can cause bias
#socosy2016 @geomblog: if the algorithm has a small training set of eg women in tech jobs, it can discriminate against them
#socosy2016 @neuraltheory: a recruiter will look at your name, your university and your job title at the last job—we look at 50k datapoints
#socosy2016 @geomblog: we are not saying you should not use algorithms, but understand how they introduce bias
#socosy2016 @tcarmody: the social contract is being replaced by the terms on service and this sets the new ideology
#socosy2016 @geomblog: what we're seeing is the same old story expressed on a different platform - who has power?
#socosy2016 @geomblog: we're seeing the same kind of amplification that happened with the printing press
#socosy2016 @dens: I went to kate's listening machines summit last summer, and I want to talk about what we're doing at foursquare
#socosy2016 @dens: we're doing listening, but not to audio, but to where phones go - where did you walk to, how long were you there
#socosy2016 @dens: we're tryign to work out the magical things we can do with that
#socosy2016 @dens: we sell some of the data, we sell some advertising, but what can we work out from this data? what should we do?
#socosy2016 @dens: I want to make software like Scarlett Johansen's character in Her that whispers to you occasionally
#socosy2016 @dens: what if you are walking down the street and it says "see that place? you should go there sometime"
#socosy2016 @dens: or when you walk into the bar it whispers "3 people you like and one you don't are here already"
#socosy2016 @dens: so many of these things you ask a question and it come to your aid when summoned - it can't suggest
#socosy2016 @dens: what if the software could summon you and say Dennis, when you leave ITP you should go to this place
#socosy2016 @dens: what if it could suggest a detour while you are walking home to an interesting store in the next street?
#socosy2016 @dens: we have an opportunity to break people out of their habits - not just reactive systems
#socosy2016 @dens: software could spot downtime and suggest detours
#socosy2016 @LatoyaPeterson: how come we always frame things as algorithms making things better? when the biases are irrational
#socosy2016 @LatoyaPeterson: why do we think we can apply rational solutions to fixing irrational responses?
#socosy2016 @LatoyaPeterson: there is this idea that more, better cleaner data will fix things
#socosy2016 @geomblog: cleaner data may fix it, but we have the bad and dirty data that gets reinforced by the algorithms
#socosy2016 @neuraltheory: if your data is talking to you you should see a doctor - you ask questions and get answers
#socosy2016 @neuraltheory: you think your dashboard is giving you answers, but it is just a bunch of bargraphs inspect questions
#socosy2016 @kevinmarks: If you ask a person to justify a decision they will confabulate an answer to justify it
#socosy2016 @kevinmarks: I'm worried that machines will be coded to confabulate plausible arguments too
#socosy2016 @tigoe: there are times when I don't trust foursquare, because it don't know when there is data that shoudl be just between us
#socosy2016 @lilich: what would you send people when they are walking to work, could you send random ones? look left
#socosy2016 @dens: what if you could make the software be flirty "I was just thinking about you - you should go to this place…"
#socosy2016 @dens: we were trying to get people feel less freaked out about the algorithm knowing about us
#socosy2016 @judithd: I want to talk about trust and cute machines that want us to trust them
#socosy2016 @judithd: in 1950 Turing wrote a paper http://www.csee.umbc.edu/courses/471/papers/turing.pdf that suggested machines should talk like humans
#socosy2016 @judithd: Weizenbaum in 1964 made Eliza that could hold a conversation by asking questions
#socosy2016 @judithd: He hoped that people would see that this was not AI, but instead people did trust it 
#socosy2016 @judithd: Weizenbaum gave up programming and wrote a novel warning of technology built by people what don't understand social
#socosy2016 @judithd: I gave a talk to a group of psychoanalysts and they were and audience that really paid attention and listened well
#socosy2016 @judithd: how many of you have worked as a waitress, where you have to fake emotion?
#socosy2016 @judithd: would you want to know what they really think of you?
#socosy2016 @judithd: this is an artificial seal that is a cuddly toy, but it can behave like an animal, curling up and responding
#socosy2016 @judithd: people with dementia are improved by contact with animals, but can't care for one—using an animated toy works for them
#socosy2016 @judithd: a tamagotchi was and electronic pet that you had to pay attention to, or it would die
#socosy2016 @judithd: the japanese tamagotchi would actually die, and not come back if neglected. The US one you could reset
#socosy2016 @judithd: if you're 3 then the world is a big psychedelic trip anyway, but when toys start actually talking that changes things
#socosy2016 @judithd: there was a russian experiment where they bred wolves for good personality, and it also gave them neonatal features
#socosy2016 @judithd: instead of using instructions to help us work tech, we make them look like babies so we take care of them
#socosy2016 @judithd: Hello Barbie is the deep sea angler fish of technology
#socosy2016 @judithd: by morphing your face with a political candidate's face you make the candidate more attractive to you
