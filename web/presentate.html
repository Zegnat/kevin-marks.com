#presentate @KuraFire: presentation software is in dire need of improvement - both for the presenter and the audience
#presentate @KuraFire: Bad powerpoint is a big problem - reading bullets aloud, overly zoomy presentations, too complicated designs
#presentate @KuraFire: People think that all this research on how to improve presentations is for the presenters, not the products
#presentate @KuraFire: Another big pain point is sharing a presentation afterwards - it's a terrible experience seeing powerpoint on a phone
#presentate @KuraFire: we feel at home on the web, and on all device- phone, tablet, desktop - it replaces the handout
#presentate @KuraFire: Great presentations are sparse and minimal, using photos - a picture is worth a thousand internet points
#presentate @KuraFire: but if your handout only has a photo and no words, they are much less use than they could be
#presentate @KuraFire: We've built the product to give you both the elegant slides and the useful handout
#presentate @KuraFire: Slide Editors try to distract you from your content with fonts, transitions and backgrounds to worry about
#presentate @KuraFire: We have a simple drafts editor in markdown, or import a post - and it makes slides from the headers
#presentate @KuraFire: we have sliders minimal ↔︎ ornate rather than a huge list of templates
#presentate @KuraFire: there is a built-in search box to find appropriate picture backgrounds for your slides
#presentate @KuraFire: The price for this is about $8 per month
#presentate @KuraFire: Scott Berkun's Confessions of a Public Speaker was one of the best things I have read on presenting
#presentate @KuraFire: If people can read for more than 5 seconds per slide they will tune you out and read the slide instead
#presentate @KuraFire: If you have a lot of animation, that is what people focus on, rather than on what you are saying
#presentate @KuraFire: there is a Free version at http://presentate.com/ that you can use and upgrade to the paid version
#presentate @KuraFire: Having screen reader accessible slides is very important to me, and it does work with them well
#presentate @KuraFire: another benefit of being screenreader friendly is that Google Translate can translate our presentations automatically
#presentate @KuraFire: one of the things we are building is live online presentations to anywhere in the world in the browser
