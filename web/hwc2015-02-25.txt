#indieweb @t: welcome to the second Homebrew Website Club of February, 4th of the year
#indieweb @kylewm2: I changed reader.kylewm.com to support pubsubhubbub so it updates in real time now
#indieweb @kylewm2: last week I was having trouble with suprfeeder being able to subscribe but @julien51 fixed it
#indieweb @kylewm2: using kylewm.superfeedr.com now works try it out
#indieweb @dariusdunlap: I moved my hosting to a Digital Ocean droplet and I'm going to post on how to do this on  https://darius.dunlaps.net
#indieweb @dariusdunlap: there's a lot of nginx config to set up so my POSSE stuff can work on the new site
#indieweb @t: it's important to document how long this config stuff takes
#indieweb @dariusdunlap: part of it for me was relearning the new sysadmin ways - nginx vs apache
#indieweb @kevinmarks: I am trying to use @medium to pst to my site - it now involves using their export process and editing the HTML
#indieweb @kevinmarks: if @medium is serious about blogging it would be great if they supported micropub
#indieweb @kevinmarks: in other news, Blogger has giving bloggers with Adult content until monday to make their blogs private
#indieweb @kabula: I have a portfolio that I coded myself; now I am trying squarespace as hosting for my own site
#indieweb @kabula: the e-commerce and blog there is really easy to create. However you have to follow their grid and layout
#indieweb @dariusdunlap: i've set up a couple of people on squarespace; there is a developer api
#indieweb @kabula: i do like how easy to is to blog using squarespace - it feels a bit like cheating
#indieweb @kabula: do I want to bake my own bread and be really proud of it, or do I want to buy bread
#indieweb @Eliservescent: it's like having a bread machine 
#indieweb @kabula: yes, as ai paid money for squarespace it is just like a bread machine
#indieweb @t: I got RSVPs saying no and maybe , and remote attending - previously I only coded how to say yes to events
#indieweb @t: a public maybe makes sense, but a public no doesn't often, but being stuck in Sydney meant I had to cancel an event
#indieweb @t: remote attending isn't a yes/no/maybe - it is another kind of thing
#indieweb @kevinmarks: most  event systems don't let you have multiple locations; only online events
#indieweb @Eliservescent: a webinar conveys a remote seminar but is rarely anything like a seminar as it isn't people interacting 
#indieweb @Eliservescent: most webinars are a broadcast lecture or a dialog between speaker and one remote, not socratic dialogue
#indieweb @Eliservescent: every time someone talks about disrupting higher education it is about having more people here a lecture
#indieweb @Eliservescent: in the humanities you do the reading at home, but the discussion is the important part
#indieweb @t: what we are doing here is more like a seminar
#indieweb @kevinmarks: so the chat room is more seminar like than the lecture?
#indieweb @Eliservescent: yes - and trying to get people to structure interaction with each other in chat rooms is hard
#indieweb @Eliservescent: I found my peer group in railsbridge, and it is the community that makes it work
#indieweb @Eliservescent: there is a lot of bootstrapping and self enablement her, but also a lot of opportunism here- audience seekers
#indieweb @Eliservescent: going to a lecture and taking a test probably teaches you less than a seminar, even if you can't measure it 
#indieweb @t: 'academic' can mean writing papers rather than writing things that work
#indieweb @t: there is a large unfiltered mass from people who have an idea, but people who have built it say "that didn't work"
#indieweb @t: if you're not willing to commit to your own website
#indieweb @Eliservescent: it is only $10/year to make a website but it feels like a bigger commitment
#indieweb @dariusdunlap: how much I spend a month is nothing compared to the time I put into it
#indieweb @Eliservescent: is wordpress the middle ground between squarespace and self hosting?
#indieweb @dariusdunlap: wordpress was that middle ground as it made it simpler a few years ago
#indieweb @t: wordpress now has got more complicated so you need to manage it too
#indieweb @t: Known @withknown is the new simplification, with thinking about mobile a key part
#indieweb @Eliservescent: where I'm frustarted when it is too easy, but then I can't customise it - I care deeply about typography
#indieweb @Eliservescent: i'm interested in pocket and instapaper because they take the page out of it's context
#indieweb @kevinmarks: a big part of what made blogging matter was the chaotic possibilities that different layouts made possible
#indieweb @kevinmarks: there are more ways to express ourselves than the 3 or 4 templates we have from twitter and facebook
#indieweb @Eliservescent: I'm reading things constantly but I'm always in a battle against the open tabs.
#indieweb @Eliservescent: 
#indieweb @Eliservescent: I have a set of bookmarks which I will never read but ti is nice to thinkI'll search them sometimes
#indieweb @Eliservescent: i feed things into del.icio.us when I have read them, but they only show up in my blog footer
#indieweb @kevinmarks: a key thing that slack does it give a link preview for anything you post so you can grasp it, and click later
#indieweb @Eliservescent: the integrations are what is key to making Slack work, as you don't have to use the service they way they chose
#indieweb @t: more important than integrating with other independent sites is plugging into where your friends read
#indieweb @t: keep integrating with lots of other service rather than forcing people to come to your site
#indieweb @Eliservescent: my comedy hack day site was http://ifthisthen.cat/ - do read the api documention
