<h2>Intro to IndieWeb</h2>
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://werd.io/'>Ben Werdmüller</a>:  <blockquote><p>we talk a lot in #indieweb about "silos" - dropbox, facebook etc who make money by locking up our data
<p>facebook is a fantastic proof of concept of a social network, but they take control away from you
<p>#indieweb is about having your own space on the web - your own domain as your primary identity
<p>the #indieweb goal is for you not to lose anything by not being in the silos, by connecting to them
<p>I haven't posted directly to facebook or twitter for a year, I post to my site and share to them instead
<p>the #indieweb community practices what we preach - we build for our own sites not making standards for other people
<p>there are lots of small building blocks that we use to build the #indieweb - microformats are how we add meaning to web pages
<p>another building block is webmentions <a class="auto-link" href="http://indiewebcamp.com/webmention">http://indiewebcamp.com/webmention</a> that tell sites when you have linked to them
<p>by using these buliding blocks we can have likes, retweets, replies, and RSVPs on our own #indieweb sites
<p>currently this is mostly about publicly visible data, but we add authentication with <a class="auto-link" href="http://indieauth.com">indieauth.com</a>
<p>we are not trying to establish a huge standards organisation, but instead a community of people who implement and discuss
<p>how many people have their own websites? [most] how many post regularly [fewer]
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.aheadrobot.com'>Stefan Magdalinski</a>:  <blockquote><p>does posting once a year count as regularly?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://aaronparecki.com'>Aaron Parecki</a>:  <blockquote><p>twitter can be almost to easy - you need an interface that is as easy to us as twitter for your own site
<p>there is an opportunity for "twitter apps" for your own site - use other people's apps to post to your own #indieweb site
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://kevinmarks.com'>Kevin Marks</a>:  <blockquote><p>shows off noterlive, which is  a way to post these kind of live tweets and keep them for posting on my own site
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://werd.io/'>Ben Werdmüller</a>:  <blockquote><p><a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/aaronpk">@aaronpk</a> has posted a photo on his site - I can reply to that using idno's firefox plugin and it shows on my site
<p>I can also reply to <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/kevinmarks">@kevinmarks</a>'s tweet using the Firefox plugin, and it posts on my site and shares it to twitter too 
<p>There's an event tomorrow night in SF called Homebrew Website Club - I can RSVP to that on my site + share to Facebook
<p>creating the twitter and facebook integrations for idno too about an hour and a half each
<p>I'd love to create a way to upload HTML5 games and post them to your site and send highscores by webmentions
<p>it's an open community - there's an IRC channel: <a class="auto-link" href="http://indiewebcamp.com/IRC">http://indiewebcamp.com/IRC</a> and a wiki<a class="auto-link" href="http://indiewebcamp.com">http://indiewebcamp.com</a> - all are welcome
<p>
<p>other sites could shut down apis, but at least you don't lose your own posts when that happens
<p>with silo'd sites there is na ethnocentric design as they're all made here in SF - indieweb is less SV dominated
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.aheadrobot.com'>Stefan Magdalinski</a>:  <blockquote><p>this is interesting from a hacker perspective, but how big can it go? this blogging will never catch on 
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://aaronparecki.com'>Aaron Parecki</a>:  <blockquote><p>there is a page on the wiki for wider adoption: <a class="auto-link" href="http://indiewebcamp.com/generations">http://indiewebcamp.com/generations</a> (there's a page for everything)
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://werd.io/'>Ben Werdmüller</a>:  <blockquote><p>we're more likely to get to mainstream by iterating on working code and consensus
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.aheadrobot.com'>Stefan Magdalinski</a>:  <blockquote><p>I've run lots of my servers at home (and fax machines) -what happens when they're all botnets?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://kevinmarks.com'>Kevin Marks</a>:  <blockquote><p>not necessarily hoem servers, can be in cloud, or even static sites that can be synced
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://aaronparecki.com'>Aaron Parecki</a>:  <blockquote><p>there are ways that we can do this with a wholly static site and services that build the communication parts
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.sbw.org/'>Steve Williams</a>:  <blockquote><p>the other way is to run an unhosted app that posts to a static server and have the data locally in the browser
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://werd.io/'>Ben Werdmüller</a>:  <blockquote><p>one advantage of making this web-centric is that we don't have to impose any architecture on anyone else to communicate
<p>how to get started? one list is at <a class="auto-link" href="http://indiewebify.me">indiewebify.me</a>
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://aaronparecki.com'>Aaron Parecki</a>:  <blockquote><p>first get your own domain and put up a page that links to your existing profiles elsewhere, so you have your own space
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>also look at <a class="auto-link" href="http://indiewebcamp.com/Getting_Started">http://indiewebcamp.com/Getting_Started</a> to see where to go
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://erinjorichey.com'>Erin Jo Richey</a>:  <blockquote><p>we're hoping by the end of the summer to have idno be a one-click install <a class="auto-link" href="http://idno.co/">http://idno.co/</a>
<p>the idno code is all on github at <a class="auto-link" href="https://github.com/idno/idno">https://github.com/idno/idno</a> tomorrow it will be called "known"
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://werd.io/'>Ben Werdmüller</a>:  <blockquote><p>we're going to switch to MySQL from mongo on idno to make it run where wordpress runs
<p>we're not quite there yet to be able to deploy a dynamic site anywhere
<p>do come to Homebrew Website Club meetings on wednesdays in SF, Portland, Chichago + sunnyvale <a class="auto-link" href="http://indiewebcamp.com/events/2014-05-07-homebrew-website-club">http://indiewebcamp.com/events/2014-05-07-homebrew-website-club</a>

<h2>IndieAuth</h2>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.sbw.org/'>Steve Williams</a>:  <blockquote><p>is indieauth what I used to log into the wiki? <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/aaronpk">@aaronpk</a>: yes <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/sbw">@sbw</a>: I have a bug report
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://aaronparecki.com'>Aaron Parecki</a>:  <blockquote><p>if you have signed into <a class="auto-link" href="http://indiewebcamp.com">indiewebcamp.com</a> you have used indieauth already
<p>If you link from your site to and form a silo with rel="me" that is relMeAuth -you delegate authentication to a silo
<p>this lets you use your own domain as the identifier, but other sites as authentication
<p><a class="auto-link" href="http://indieauth.com">indieauth.com</a> is a little confusing as it is doing two things
<p><a class="auto-link" href="http://indieauth.com">indieauth.com</a> came from wanting to add relMeAuth to mediawiki on <a class="auto-link" href="http://indiewebcamp.com">indiewebcamp.com</a>
<p>instead of getting down in mediawiki code to add auth, I made <a class="auto-link" href="http://indieauth.com">indieauth.com</a> do to auth as service
<p>by making <a class="auto-link" href="http://indieauth.com">indieauth.com</a> a service, I could add a small plugin to mediawiki to talk to indieauth
<p>I initially didn't expect anyone else to use <a class="auto-link" href="http://indieauth.com">indieauth.com</a> originally
<p>one of the things that OAuth2 did different from OAuth1 was separating auth as an internal service
<p>after I made it work with the wiki, I made it work with my own site hosting p3k
<p>we need to find an OAuth2 provider agreed on between indieauth and the user
<p>I had the same problem with posting to my own site - I needed authZ to post to my own site
<p><a class="auto-link" href="http://ownyourgram.com/">http://ownyourgram.com/</a> is a way to post to your micropub endpoint when you send photos to instagram
<p>as OAuth2 doesn't specify discovery, we have OpenID Connect, and no other spec. 
<p>I used rel=authorization-endpoint and rel=token-endpoint from existing specs and made up rel=micropub
<p>one of my goals is to avoid crypto and rely on TLS like OAuth2 did (it seemed like a good idea at the time)
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://kevinmarks.com'>Kevin Marks</a>:  <blockquote><p>well, the SSL code has had a lot of people look at it closely recently
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://justin.richer.org/'>Justin Richer</a>:  <blockquote><p><a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/aaronpk">@aaronpk</a> should look up token introspection as an OAuth spec (which I wrote) - similar to IndieAuth token factoring
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://aaronparecki.com'>Aaron Parecki</a>:  <blockquote><p>indieuath can be an internal part of the wiki, or it can be service that the user's micropub site uses
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://justin.richer.org/'>Justin Richer</a>:  <blockquote><p>UMA is a protocol built on OAuth2 and OpenID connect to introduce the client to the auth services
<p>there's a lot of potential synergy between UMA and what the Indieauth delegation is trying to do
<p>there is a profile of OpenID Connect that lets you defer verifying the signature, but implementations do it anyway
<p>what if you don't have an HTML parser?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://kevinmarks.com'>Kevin Marks</a>:  <blockquote><p>we have an HTML parser service in the cloud that will make it into JSON for you #indieweb
