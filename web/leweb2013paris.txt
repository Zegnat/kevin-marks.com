#leweb @ilyasu: 10 years is a long time, it's longer than my entire career. The question is how people will discover apps
#leweb @ilyasu: what if Siri responded with a ranked list of apps for a query? [sounds like @DoAT to me]
#leweb @ilyasu: I recently switched to Android, and I think Google Now is a pretty great product - google should offer that to developers
#leweb @AnthonyTjan: Baseball has now formalised analytics - 26 out of 30 teams now have an analytic team
#leweb @AnthonyTjan: 4 key trends: Algorithmic, Women, Interdependent, High-Low Tech
#leweb @AnthonyTjan: 4 key traits of entrepreneurs: heart, smarts, guts and luck - which one drives you?
#leweb @AnthonyTjan: Tounderstand heart, watch Jiro Dreams of Sushi - get it on your netflix now [there's no Netflix in France, is there?]
#leweb @AnthonyTjan: 70% of businesses with a formal exit or IPO did not start with a business plan - heart driven wins out #tummel
#leweb @AnthonyTjan: Pattern recognision is at the essence of smart entrepreneurship
#leweb @AnthonyTjan: Guts dominant entrepreneurs: 30% have failed before - 1 in 3 are serial entrepreneurs

#leweb @loic:  here are future entrepreneurs: [leads a whole 6th grade french class onstage]
#leweb @jowyang: six months ago I was talking about the collaborative economy, and asking if big companies could be part of this
#leweb @jowyang: The last 10 years have been democratising media - 10 years ago Le Web was Les Blogs
#leweb @jowyang: the tools we used to use to publish media are now being used to build products in the physical world
#leweb @jowyang: we're going to see the democratisation of the physical world in the next 10 years
#leweb @jowyang: big trends: 3D printing; high funded sharing economy; Crowdfunding and Bitcoin
#leweb @jowyang: Corporations are making the crowd part of their company: eg GE working with Quirky
#leweb @jowyang: U-Haul sells U-Notes in increments of $100 to create a shared fate - the highest form of loyalty
#leweb @jowyang: A company called Custom Made make high end matching jewelry to match the Lincoln car
#leweb @jowyang: Ask Executives what the purpose of business is, Profit is the biggest. Millennials say Societal Development, Innovation
#leweb @jowyang: Toms shoes launched a marketplace selling artisans' social good products
#leweb @jowyang: Nokia released 3D printable files to enable custom cases to be made
#leweb @jowyang: I'm starting a new company called crowdcompanies.com as a Brand Counceil for large companies who want to Collaborate
#leweb @jowyang: The bog corporations pay, the startups don't
#leweb @jowyang: people can make physical goods and share them instead fo buying anew
#leweb @jowyang: Corporations that partner with these empowered people can become resilient
#leweb @om: Tony and I are old friends and partners at the VC fund True Ventures
#leweb @om: you founded about.me, sold it to AOL, and then you bought it back. Tempting fate?
#leweb @tonysphere: I realised at AOL that there weren't as many integration opportunities as we had thought - they were more media
#leweb @tonysphere: we decided to focus on engagement rather than growth
#leweb @tonysphere: you shouldn't be defined by algorithms or your professional experience, but how you see yourself [a fake #indieweb?]
#leweb @tonysphere:  I start to see 19-year old college kids use about.me as a resume to get internships
#leweb @tonysphere: these pages can create value for you even if you don't go back to the product -linkedin and about.me are like that
#leweb @tonysphere: you are curious about who is curious about you, so we tell you who put you in categories or viewed your page
#leweb @tonysphere: we are seeing a lot of party round financing, which can give the illusion of progress - do you have an anchor [VC FUD?]
#leweb @om: there isn't enough time in the day to go through each pitch and each company. How do you rise above the crowd?
#leweb @tonysphere: if you're becoming a founder you need to think of a 35 year career - cultivating relationships
#leweb @om: startups aren't fighting the battle for money, you're fighting for talent and attention. Without those you won't succeed
#leweb @tonysphere: startup founders now as opposed to ten years ago are so much more knowledgeable
#leweb @tonysphere: Matt Mullenweg was betting on us to be good stewards. Today he'd be plugged in to so much more
#leweb @om: Startup founders are so much more informed, but are they more knowledgeable? How do they break out?
#leweb @tonysphere: in the next 10 years startup activity is going to go off the hook - we just invested in a submarine robotics company!
#leweb @om: I wantto thank @loic and @geraldine for making Le Web the most important conference in Europe
#leweb @sippey: twitter has its roots in mobile - it started out in text messaging and became web later
#leweb @sippey: at twitter we were very early in the app store for iOS and Android [er, not earlier than 3rd parties]
#leweb @sippey: we made the first big change to the home timeline in a long time, by making it easier to follow conversations [blue lines]
#leweb @sippey: you'll now see photos and video in the timeline now @loic: from instagram? @sippey: no, ask them why
#leweb @sippey: We've taken mobile development and distributed throughout the company - a team developing photos has iOS+Android engs too
#leweb @sippey: we've built an experimentation framework into iOS and Android apps so we can run % experiments on mobile too
#leweb @sippey: we use the data to influence the decision, but not to define it
#leweb @sippey: we met Vine: classic team of a designer, a product manager and an engineer - @loic: you really need a designer now
#leweb @sippey: Vine was the first app that din't have a record button or a play button - you just tap and hold @loic: snapchat does too
#leweb @sippey: Vine have a lot of autonomy and independence -they have a separate office in NYC
#leweb @loic: why not a separate photo app too?
#leweb @sippey: twitter incorporated photos into the core twitter app experience before i joined
#leweb @loic: how do you see snapchat and ephemeral content?
#leweb @sippey: I think snapchat found something interesting - using photos and videos to briefly communicate
#leweb @sippey: we're looking at how we solve the users problems
#leweb @loic: so you're building a Snapchat competitor?
#leweb @sippey: No we're not.
#leweb @loic: how about you post a tweet and it disappears? [could write that with the API - auto-delete]
#leweb @loic: I have an 18 year old in college who sends me things on SnapChat that are disturbing
#leweb @sippey: we have a lot of users in school or college who use twitter for public communication among their peers
#leweb @loic: how do you see Facebook versus twitter - they seem to be one by one taking your features?
#leweb @loic: have you read @nickbilton's book Hatching Twitter? I highly recommend it
#leweb @sippey: what our users tell us that they love about twitter is that it is live, public conversational and distributed everywhere
#leweb @loic: I can't follow whats happeneing around Le Web on facebook, only twitter
#leweb @sippey: we've done a lot of work on search, and integration with television - putting on air and sending back
#leweb @loic: Facebook have a feed, but their search sucks
#leweb @sippey: Facebook has their product, I'm focused on twitter - not looking at them but at us
#leweb @sippey: I joined sixapart in 2004 -we were all blogging then, The shift has been to mobile and cloud enabling small teams
#leweb @sippey: in 10 years the devices we carry will have better sensors and tools to share content and context from wherever we are
#leweb @sippey: you can tell we're old as we both have watches my watch is a heads up display for time and date-
#leweb @sippey: last year @KatieS was here at Le Web - she's building up international here at a great rate
#leweb @loic: politicians in France talk amongst each other - thats amazing to me
#leweb @sippey: usernames will stay, but we hear from new users that @ handles and hashtags are confusing so we need to help
#leweb @sippey: if you think twitter hasn't changed much then we're doing our job - it feels familiar but it develops well
#leweb @sippey: the IPO hasn't really changed the company - we've been focused on a sustainable business and executing well
#leweb @sippey: the market invests in the future of the company, and we're building that future
#leweb @sippey: if you have product ideas, email me sippey@twitter.com, or tweet me
#leweb @nickdaloisio: the reason I built summly was because of all the time i spent going back and forth between results and apges
#leweb @nickdaloisio: the summly algorithm is used in the Yahoo App in the US app store
#leweb @nickdaloisio: I'm full time at Yahoo, but I'm finishing my A-Levels at school too
#leweb @loic: So, you sold summly for $30 million?
#leweb @nickdaloisio: I can't say. No really, I can't tell you.
#leweb @nickdaloisio: yahoo has huge corpora - so much information. Making that personal could be really interesting
#leweb @nickdaloisio: a lot of the time wasted on mobile is people faffing about trying to find what they want
#leweb @nickdaloisio: if you have a conversation you forget half of it in an hour. Permanancy isn't natural for humans. Snapchat does that
#leweb @loic: so our conversation is transient, unless you're like @scobleizer. Fortunately we're not all like Scoble
#leweb @nickdaloisio: there is a value for permancy, as long as I want it to be. I don't necessarily want it read back to me in 5 years
#leweb @nickdaloisio: people take screenshots of private chat conversations in Facebook etc and post them. They want to avoid that
#leweb @nickdaloisio: I'm fascinated by self-learning - making accessibility if knowledge really easy and fun is what I care about
#leweb @nickdaloisio: even though I had IT lessons at school, there was no idea of starting a company instead of joining one. teach that too
#leweb @nickdaloisio: making entrepreneurship as an option available for schools around the world is key
#leweb @nickdaloisio: I think Bitcoin is interesting, but I don't know much about it. I like the decentralisation
#leweb @nickdaloisio: when I was doing summly it was great to have Angels to lean on when it went badly. Crowdsourced doesn't do that
#leweb @nickdaloisio: It's important to raise external capital because it keeps you in check - you need external people to keep you in line
#leweb @loic: you can tell this bitcoin video is old as it says they're worth $70 each
#leweb @JamesCurrier: Nothing is more network affect-y than currencies. I was at Linden, and we never quite spun out Linden dollars
#leweb @garrickhileman: is an economic historian at LSE
#leweb @JamesCurrier: 3000 years ago, people used gold and sliver both for storage of value and exchange of value
#leweb @JamesCurrier: pre 1863 in the US there were 8000 entities printing their own money - it was unwieldy and prone to forgery
#leweb @JamesCurrier: the gold standard was invented in 1821 by Britain, and the US went off it in 1971
#leweb @JamesCurrier: in 2002 QQ's q-coins were used outside QQ.com - the chinese govt banned this in 2007
#leweb @JamesCurrier: 2009-2012 Facebook credits came out, but despite their ability to fore peoepl to use it, it still died out
#leweb @JamesCurrier: No-one owns bitcoin -the founders found a way to disappear [except they have the bulk of holdings]
#leweb @JamesCurrier: anonymity of BitCoin has had a lot of press, but the 3 big drugs and guns marketplaces have been shut down this year
#leweb @JamesCurrier: in 2013 Bernanke said that the US wasn't interested in regiulating virtual currencies 
#leweb @JamesCurrier: People's Bank of China recently said that companies and banks should not accept them, though individuals could
#leweb @JamesCurrier: You can only spend bitcoin in about 1000 places worldwide
#leweb @JamesCurrier: up until a few weeks ago, 65% of bitcoin trading was in china. That may change now the Bank of China has spoken
#leweb @JamesCurrier: there are about 60 other digital currencies that have copied this idea
#leweb @garrickhileman: Technology folks are excited about crypto and exotic hardware. Governments are excited too
#leweb @garrickhileman: Governments worry about the money laundering aspects of bitcoin, but care about the growth potential
#leweb @garrickhileman: VC's are excited about bitcoin because they see it as disrupting the multi-billion payments industry
#leweb @shak: the Western Union remittance model has fees of about 20% on $100 right now to send money internationally now
#leweb @shak: international trade now hits merchants with huge transaction fees and exchange fees - that is billions too
#leweb @garrickhileman: think of Argentina or another country with a weak domestic currency. Cyprus crisis showed this as Bitcoin went up
#leweb @garrickhileman: At the moment Bitcoin is mostly a store of value, not a transaction currency.
#leweb @shak: we need more mainstream adoption - we need someone like Amazon, not just @eff and wordpress
#leweb @shak: will a CFO of a pubicly listed company want that risk?
#leweb @JamesCurrier: talking to a Silicon Valley Bank about bitcoin, they are waiting for a stable set of rules first
#leweb @shak: regarding tangibility, I remember this argument against spotify when Daniel Ek launched it. The mindset changes
#leweb @shak: Bitcoin is not much different than people using tap to pay to pay for their coffee
#leweb @shak: Merrill Lynch published a large report about Bitcoin last week, we're seeing lots of finance industry interest
#leweb @shak: lot of retailers like Walmart and UK high street chains are seriously looking into Bitcoin
#leweb @garrickhileman: European sovereign debt crisis is not resolved. The IMF recently talked about capital controls; Bitcoin avoids them
#leweb @shak: "anyone with significant wealth should put 1% into bitcoin" - danger is not understanding it
#leweb @shak: what really worries me going forward is people putting money into bitcoin to speculate in it
#leweb @garrickhileman: China's stance on Bitcoin was not as strong as on QQ, because it is not centralised and harder to regulate
#leweb @garrickhileman: the most common cause of death of alternative currencies is technical advance or lack of demand
#leweb @garrickhileman: we can see that Bitcoin has problems in the 10 minutes it takes to update the blockchain
#leweb @garrickhileman: Satoshi retained enough bitcoins to be a billionaire, the litecoin founder deliberately has not.
#leweb @shak: look at the gap between what understanding we have and the mainstream
#leweb @garrickhileman: Money is an abstract thing to begin with. Bitcoin has no actual coins and bills
#leweb @garrickhileman: ultimately all currencies are backed by supply and demand - look at Zimbabwe losing it's currency
#leweb @shak: Governments can be allies and enemies, purely from lack of understanding. Financial systems are already broken
#leweb @shak: if people are accepting that music and videos come from this thing called a cloud, virtual currency is not so different
#leweb @garrickhileman: prior to the explosion in cryptocurrencies there were 4000 alternative currencies around the world. It's hard to do
#leweb @garrickhileman: we may need focus on one currency to get the growth
#leweb @shak: I'm an investor in Bitpay. The most fascinating companies in digital payments are being built right now. we'll see some Q1
#leweb @shak: what is also required apart from the techincal solution is the consumer trust and branding that they need
#leweb @shak: the people we hear about losing bitcoins is usually not the protocol but someone running a 'bank' designed to steal them
#leweb @garrickhileman: we don't know what the price of bitcoin is now. Coindesk's price info is valuable here
#leweb @JamesCurrier: should the audience be investing in bitcoin?
#leweb @shak: only if you have money you are prepared to lose you can lose all you put in.

Day 2

#leweb @dinakaplan: I say this not to sound boastful or American, if those are really two different things, but because I was full of fear.
#leweb @dinakaplan: I realise now that I was afraid to ask for help- that people would think I was not capable
#leweb @dinakaplan: I had no women role models to look up to, so I had to emulate men. I suppressed every single emotion that I felt
#leweb @dinakaplan: I felt like an actress playing the role of an entrepreneur. This was imposter syndrome.
#leweb @dinakaplan: I was afraid that I'd collapse when crossing the street in New York. I quit my job + booked a 1 way ticket to Indonesia
#leweb @dinakaplan: After trevelling the world, collecting countries for the facebook photos, I took a ten day meditation retreat.
#leweb @dinakaplan: I realised that I had only wanted to be liked. 
#leweb @briansolis: The next 10 years are either going to happen to us, or because of us.
#leweb @briansolis: this woman took a selfie in front of someone committing suicide on the Brooklyn Bridge. This is your customer
#leweb @elatable: I have tremendous respect for Snapchat - they have obviously tapped into a key human behaviour there
#leweb @elatable: very few companies have the resources to think in ten year timeframes like Google can, so we have a responsibility
#leweb @loic: why don't you wear google glass? @elatable: I need these glasses [not eligible for Lasic? as a googler asked me]
#leweb @elatable: as well as self-driving cars and Glass, other moonshots are Chrome and Android - which now seem obvious
#leweb @elatable: We're not afraid at google of doing things that are technologically significant and take a while
#leweb @elatable: we don't just backup and upload your photos, we use the compute power of Google to smooth wrinkles on people's faces
#leweb @elatable: Plus Post Ads promote brands google plus posts out to the rest of the web.
#leweb @elatable: we've introduced a new google ad format which is a G+ post that users can comment on and engage with elsewhere on the web
#leweb @elatable: YouTube now uses Google+ for commenting, so you can go to a billion view video like Gangnam style and see friends comments
#leweb @elatable: we had a lot of problems with ranking of g+ comments on YouTube, but we have made changes to make them better
#leweb @elatable: Google Plus has never been about Facebook - it solves a very different use case as it is private
#leweb @elatable: Google Hangouts taps into the same use case as Snapchat - its ephemeral and easy and has recording protections
#leweb @elatable: YouTube integration, Google Drive and all the other G+ integrations were part of the plan, and there will be more
#leweb @elatable: we have a lot of apis and services available for developers to work with, it's not just about us buying companies
#leweb @elatable: you don't want to optimise your company to be bought by google, build a great company and it's a side effect
#leweb @pre_me: Scoble's jacket is like a clown car of gadgets - things keep coming out of his pockets
#leweb @Scobleizer: the Oakley ski goggles are full of sensors that can measure your hang time on the mountain: everything has sensors
#leweb @Scobleizer: Location and Social data is growing all the time. 500M tweets/day now
#leweb @Scobleizer: Data is being used everywhere - with Hadoop and machine learning to make sense of it
#leweb @Scobleizer: Context means anticipatory software that knows what you're going to do - Google Now is an example
#leweb @Scobleizer: smart bluetooth beacons sit there and spit a number into the air every few seconds and we can find where they are
#leweb @pre_me: eightly is a product that builds on what we made with Dashboard - let anyone make apps foriOS
#leweb @pre_me: back in the day there was a crazy thing called Hypercard that let you put buttons on things, we want that everywhere
#leweb @pre_me: we have cards for each thing and you join them together to make up a story
#leweb @pre_me: we automate all the layout so you don't have to worry about that.
#leweb @hbarra: I've been in China 2 months but it feels like a lot longer than that - my mind is blown every single day
#leweb @hbarra: China is a parallel universe - when it comes to tech. China has 8 million college graduates a year vs 3 million in the US
#leweb @hbarra: 600 million internet users in China - 500 million smartphone users that has doubled in 6 months
#leweb @hbarra: there is not one Western app in the top ten of apps in China, QQ has 5 of them QQ 600m users
#leweb @hbarra: Taobao - is more than twice ebay and amazon combined - you can buy anything on Taobao
#leweb @hbarra: China's Singles Day is like the opposite of Valentines Day - you celebrate by buying things for yourself online
#leweb @hbarra: Singles Day was $5.7B = over $1B from phones. 
#leweb @hbarra: JD (formerly 360buy) will deliver same day from thousands of things - 3 hour delivery
#leweb @hbarra: Alipay is about 1/3 of all chinese payments $1000B vs $180B for paypal
#leweb @hbarra: Weibo looks a lot like twitter, but I got 200,000 followers in 2 months
#leweb @hbarra: my entire social life in China revolves about Wechat - no phone, text or email.
#leweb @hbarra: Wechat has an instagram-like feature for photos too
#leweb @hbarra: DIDI is like the chinese version of Uber - but chinese addresses don't make sense so you record them instructions
#leweb @hbarra: most of the chinese taxi drivers bought smartphones so they can run the DiDI app
#leweb @hbarra: there are over 100 android app stores in china because google's app store is banned by the govt
#leweb @hbarra: taiwanese android devices can have the actual google app store, but not mainland one.
#leweb @hbarra: my job is to take Xiaomi's phones outside of china - we're starting in south-east asia
#leweb @brady: I spend about a week a month in China, getting to know what startups need- and it's mostly more tools
#leweb @brady: The Arduino happened almost by accident- it was designed by an italian professor for his students, open sourced and spread
#leweb @brady: I run Highway1 because I believe that hardware is the future - we take startups to china to learn to manufacture
#leweb @brady: our first incubated compay, birdi, launched on indiegogo today: http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/birdi
#leweb @brady: hardware prototyping can be done easily now, raising dollars on kickstarter can be done, but shipping thousands is a dark art
#leweb @brady: Scale requires rigor - you need partners in Huaqiangbei - hardware flows like software
#leweb @brady: Bunny Hwang's http://circuitstickers.com/ was built on a field trip to china
#leweb @brady: Manufacturing informs your product- you can't just hit go on the 3D printer and have it work in the factory
#leweb @brady: Software matters - its what makes the product make sense and makes your users love you.
#leweb @brady: We're going to be inundated with connected gadgets that don't talk to each other. We need an OS for IoT
#leweb @brady: Big box retailers need to be made startup friendly - they currently demand too much inventory
#leweb @brady: applications are now open at angel.co/highway1 
#leweb @rhyme_andreason: I'm wearing 3D printed shoes - this is a revolution as shoemaking hasn't changed in a century
#leweb @rhyme_andreason: there is a new 3D printer launched every week on kickstarter, and they're big enough to print shoes
#leweb @rhyme_andreason: any thermoplastic can be put into a 3D printer, which means many different possible materials for shoes
#leweb @rhyme_andreason: unlike a cellphone, you have to make sizes for shoes - 3D printing makes this easier
#leweb @rhyme_andreason: We don't sell printers, we sell shoes as they have more margin and more speed for fashion 
#leweb @rhyme_andreason: it takes several hours to print a shoe, but we can just get more machines, and we can still turnround in a  day
#leweb @rhyme_andreason: you can see the printer not making solid shoes but a subtle honeycombed interior space
#leweb @rhyme_andreason: we optimize the machine path file for a specific design, making it smoother and 25% faster
#leweb @rhyme_andreason: we can make different designs from a basic ballet flat by using images as bump maps to emboss them
#leweb @rhyme_andreason: we're going to make ready-to-wear 3D printed shoes, not just for the runway
#leweb @rhyme_andreason: we need slightly bigger printers for mens shoes, @brady
