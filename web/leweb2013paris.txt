#leweb @ilyasu: 10 years is a long time, it's longer than my entire career. The question is how people will discover apps

#leweb @ilyasu: I recently switched to Android, and I think Google Now is a pretty great product - google should offer that to developers

#leweb @jowyang: six months ago I was talking about the collaborative economy, and asking if big companies could be part of this
#leweb @jowyang: The last 10 years have been democratising media - 10 years ago Le Web was Les Blogs
#leweb @jowyang: the tools we used to use to publish media are now being used to build products in the physical world
#leweb @jowyang: we're going to see the democratisation of the physical world in the next 10 years
#leweb @jowyang: big trends: 3D printing; high funded sharing economy; Crowdfunding and Bitcoin
#leweb @jowyang: Corporations are making the crowd part of their company: eg GE working with Quirky

#leweb @jowyang: A company called Custom Made make high end matching jewelry to match the Lincoln car

#leweb @jowyang: people can make physical goods and share them instead fo buying anew
#leweb @jowyang: Corporations that partner with these empowered people can become resilient
#leweb @om: Tony and I are old friends and partners at the VC fund True Ventures
#leweb @om: you founded about.me, sold it to AOL, and then you bought it back. Tempting fate?
#leweb @tonysphere: I realised at AOL that there weren't as many integration opportunities as we had thought - they were more media
#leweb @tonysphere: we decided to focus on engagement rather than growth
#leweb @tonysphere: you shouldn't be defined by algorithms or your professional experience, but how you see yourself [a fake #indieweb?]
#leweb @tonysphere:  I start to see 19-year old college kids use about.me as a resume to get internships
#leweb @tonysphere: these pages can create value for you even if you don't go back to the product -linkedin and about.me are like that
#leweb @tonysphere: you are curious about who is curious about you, so we tell you who put you in categories or viewed your page
#leweb @tonysphere: we are seeing a lot of party round financing, which can give the illusion of progress - do you have an anchor [VC FUD?]
#leweb @om: there isn't enough time in the day to go through each pitch and each company. How do you rise above the crowd?
#leweb @tonysphere: if you're becoming a founder you need to think of a 35 year career - cultivating relationships
#leweb @om: startups aren't fighting the battle for money, you're fighting for talent and attention. Without those you won't succeed
#leweb @tonysphere: startup founders now as opposed to ten years ago are so much more knowledgeable
#leweb @tonysphere: Matt Mullenweg was betting on us to be good stewards. Today he'd be plugged in to so much more
#leweb @om: Startup founders are so much more informed, but are they more knowledgeable? How do they break out?
#leweb @tonysphere: in the next 10 years startup activity is going to go off the hook - we just invested in a submarine robotics company!
#leweb @om: I wantto thank @loic and @geraldine for making Le Web the most important conference in Europe
#leweb @sippey: twitter has its roots in mobile - it started out in text messaging and became web later
#leweb @sippey: at twitter we were very early in the app store for iOS and Android [er, not earlier than 3rd parties]
#leweb @sippey: we made the first big change to the home timeline in a long time, by making it easier to follow conversations [blue lines]
#leweb @sippey: you'll now see photos and video in the timeline now @loic: from instagram? @sippey: no, ask them why
#leweb @sippey: We've taken mobile development and distributed throughout the company - a team developing photos has iOS+Android engs too
#leweb @sippey: we've built an experimentation framework into iOS and Android apps so we can run % experiments on mobile too
#leweb @sippey: we use the data to influence the decision, but not to define it
#leweb @sippey: we met Vine: classic team of a designer, a product manager and an engineer - @loic: you really need a designer now
#leweb @sippey: Vine was the first app that din't have a record button or a play button - you just tap and hold @loic: snapchat does too
#leweb @sippey: Vine have a lot of autonomy and independence -they have a separate office in NYC
#leweb @loic: why not a separate photo app too?
#leweb @sippey: twitter incorporated photos into the core twitter app experience before i joined
#leweb @loic: how do you see snapchat and ephemeral content?
#leweb @sippey: I think snapchat found something interesting - using photos and videos to briefly communicate
#leweb @sippey: we're looking at how we solve the users problems
#leweb @loic: so you're building a Snapchat competitor?
#leweb @sippey: No we're not.
#leweb @loic: how about you post a tweet and it disappears? [could write that with the API - auto-delete]
#leweb @loic: I have an 18 year old in college who sends me things on SnapChat that are disturbing
#leweb @sippey: we have a lot of users in school or college who use twitter for public communication among their peers
#leweb @loic: how do you see Facebook versus twitter - they seem to be one by one taking your features?
#leweb @loic: have you read @nickbilton's book Hatching Twitter? I highly recommend it
#leweb @sippey: what our users tell us that they love about twitter is that it is live, public conversational and distributed everywhere
#leweb @loic: I can't follow whats happeneing around Le Web on facebook, only twitter
#leweb @sippey: we've done a lot of work on search, and integration with television - putting on air and sending back
#leweb @loic: Facebook have a feed, but their search sucks
#leweb @sippey: Facebook has their product, I'm focused on twitter - not looking at them but at us
#leweb @sippey: I joined sixapart in 2004 -we were all blogging then, The shift has been to mobile and cloud enabling small teams
#leweb @sippey: in 10 years the devices we carry will have better sensors and tools to share content and context from wherever we are
#leweb @sippey: you can tell we're old as we both have watches my watch is a heads up display for time and date-
#leweb @sippey: last year @KatieS was here at Le Web - she's building up international here at a great rate
#leweb @loic: politicians in France talk amongst each other - thats amazing to me
#leweb @sippey: usernames will stay, but we hear from new users that @ handles and hashtags are confusing so we need to help
#leweb @sippey: if you think twitter hasn't changed much then we're doing our job - it feels familiar but it develops well
#leweb @sippey: the IPO hasn't really changed the company - we've been focused on a sustainable business and executing well
#leweb @sippey: the market invests in the future of the company, and we're building that future
#leweb @sippey: if you have product ideas, email me sippey@twitter.com, or tweet me
#leweb @nickdaloisio: the reason I built summly was because of all the time i spent going back and forth between results and apges
#leweb @nickdaloisio: the summly algorithm is used in the Yahoo App in the US app store
#leweb @nickdaloisio: I'm full time at Yahoo, but I'm finishing my A-Levels at school too
#leweb @loic: So, you sold summly for $30 million?
#leweb @nickdaloisio: I can't say. No really, I can't tell you.
#leweb @nickdaloisio: yahoo has huge corpora - so much information. Making that personal could be really interesting
#leweb @nickdaloisio: a lot of the time wasted on mobile is people faffing about trying to find what they want
#leweb @nickdaloisio: if you have a conversation you forget half of it in an hour. Permanancy isn't natural for humans. Snapchat does that
#leweb @loic: so our conversation is transient, unless you're like @scobleizer. Fortunately we're not all like Scoble
#leweb @nickdaloisio: there is a value for permancy, as long as I want it to be. I don't necessarily want it read back to me in 5 years
#leweb @nickdaloisio: people take screenshots of private chat conversations in Facebook etc and post them. They want to avoid that
#leweb @nickdaloisio: I'm fascinated by self-learning - making accessibility if knowledge really easy and fun is what I care about
#leweb @nickdaloisio: even though I had IT lessons at school, there was no idea of starting a company instead of joining one. teach that too
#leweb @nickdaloisio: making entrepreneurship as an option available for schools around the world is key
#leweb @nickdaloisio: I think Bitcoin is interesting, but I don't know much about it. I like the decentralisation
#leweb @nickdaloisio: when I was doing summly it was great to have Angels to lean on when it went badly. Crowdsourced doesn't do that
#leweb @nickdaloisio: It's important to raise external capital because it keeps you in check - you need external people to keep you in line
#leweb @loic: you can tell this bitcoin video is old as it says they're worth $70 each
#leweb @JamesCurrier: Nothing is more network affect-y than currencies. I was at Linden, and we never quite spun out Linden dollars
#leweb @garrickhileman: is an economic historian at LSE
#leweb @JamesCurrier: 3000 years ago, people used gold and sliver both for storage of value and exchange of value
#leweb @JamesCurrier: pre 1863 in the US there were 8000 entities printing their own money - it was unwieldy and prone to forgery
#leweb @JamesCurrier: the gold standard was invented in 1821 by Britain, and the US went off it in 1971
#leweb @JamesCurrier: in 2002 QQ's q-coins were used outside QQ.com - the chinese govt banned this in 2007
#leweb @JamesCurrier: 2009-2012 Facebook credits came out, but despite their ability to fore peoepl to use it, it still died out
#leweb @JamesCurrier: No-one owns bitcoin -the founders found a way to disappear [except they have the bulk of holdings]
#leweb @JamesCurrier: anonymity of BitCoin has had a lot of press, but the 3 big drugs and guns marketplaces have been shut down this year
#leweb @JamesCurrier: in 2013 Bernanke said that the US wasn't interested in regiulating virtual currencies 
#leweb @JamesCurrier: People's Bank of China recently said that companies and banks should not accept them, though individuals could
#leweb @JamesCurrier: You can only spend bitcoin in about 1000 places worldwide
#leweb @JamesCurrier: up until a few weeks ago, 65% of bitcoin trading was in china. That may change now the Bank of China has spoken
#leweb @JamesCurrier: there are about 60 other digital currencies that have copied this idea
#leweb @garrickhileman: Technology folks are excited about crypto and exotic hardware. Governments are excited too
#leweb @garrickhileman: Governments worry about the money laundering aspects of bitcoin, but care about the growth potential
#leweb @garrickhileman: VC's are excited about bitcoin because they see it as disrupting the multi-billion payments industry
#leweb @shak: the Western Union remittance model has fees of about 20% on $100 right now to send money internationally now
#leweb @shak: international trade now hits merchants with huge transaction fees and exchange fees - that is billions too
#leweb @garrickhileman: think of Argentina or another country with a weak domestic currency. Cyprus crisis showed this as Bitcoin went up
#leweb @garrickhileman: At the moment Bitcoin is mostly a store of value, not a transaction currency.
#leweb @shak: we need more mainstream adoption - we need someone like Amazon, not just @eff and wordpress
#leweb @shak: will a CFO of a pubicly listed company want that risk?
#leweb @JamesCurrier: talking to a Silicon Valley Bank about bitcoin, they are waiting for a stable set of rules first
#leweb @shak: regarding tangibility, I remember this argument against spotify when Daniel Ek launched it. The mindset changes
#leweb @shak: Bitcoin is not much different than people using tap to pay to pay for their coffee
#leweb @shak: Merrill Lynch published a large report about Bitcoin last week, we're seeing lots of finance industry interest
#leweb @shak: lot of retailers like Walmart and UK high street chains are seriously looking into Bitcoin
#leweb @garrickhileman: European sovereign debt crisis is not resolved. The IMF recently talked about capital controls; Bitcoin avoids them
#leweb @shak: "anyone with significant wealth should put 1% into bitcoin" - danger is not understanding it
#leweb @shak: what really worries me going forward is people putting money into bitcoin to speculate in it
#leweb @garrickhileman: China's stance on Bitcoin was not as strong as on QQ, because it is not centralised and harder to regulate
#leweb @garrickhileman: the most common cause of death of alternative currencies is technical advance or lack of demand
#leweb @garrickhileman: we can see that Bitcoin has problems in the 10 minutes it takes to update the blockchain
#leweb @garrickhileman: Satoshi retained enough bitcoins to be a billionaire, the litecoin founder deliberately has not.
#leweb @shak: look at the gap between what understanding we have and the mainstream
#leweb @garrickhileman: Money is an abstract thing to begin with. Bitcoin has no actual coins and bills
#leweb @garrickhileman: ultimately all currencies are backed by supply and demand - look at Zimbabwe losing it's currency
#leweb @shak: Governments can be allies and enemies, purely from lack of understanding. Financial systems are already broken
#leweb @shak: if people are accepting that music and videos come from this thing called a cloud, virtual currency is not so different
#leweb @garrickhileman: prior to the explosion in cryptocurrencies there were 4000 alternative currencies around the world. It's hard to do
#leweb @garrickhileman: we may need focus on one currency to get the growth
#leweb @shak: I'm an investor in Bitpay. The most fascinating companies in digital payments are being built right now. we'll see some Q1
#leweb @shak: what is also required apart from the techincal solution is the consumer trust and branding that they need
#leweb @shak: the people we hear about losing bitcoins is usually not the protocol but someone running a 'bank' designed to steal them
#leweb @garrickhileman: we don't know what the price of bitcoin is now. Coindesk's price info is valuable here
#leweb @JamesCurrier: should the audience be investing in bitcoin?
#leweb @shak: only if you have money you are prepared to lose you can lose all you put in.
