<p>when I get a webmention it goes through the approve() function and checks if I have linked to you before
<p>if I send a webmention from a non approved domain it sends a 449 code instead

<p>the <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/twitter">@twitter</a> export drops timestamps for tweets before 2010
<p>I parse the json from the twitter export and post them to known in backwards order for each month
<p>I use the new "nomention" feature <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/benwerd">@benwerd</a> added to the API so I don't send 7 years of webmentions on import
<p>Known was timing out trying to get the webmention endpoint for Dopplr as the site is dead

<p>I rewrote the db backend and the indieauth/micropib plugin
<p>I added a following UI to Known that gets other people's posts in microformats
<p>I can also follow non-microformats sites too eg Anil Dash
<p>I need to add back the response and like buttons so I can read the whole web on my site

<p>teacup is for tracking your drinks - it lets you choose what you are drinking now and post it
<p>it also does browser geolocation and has an "add to homescreen" button
<p>the app is at <a class="auto-link" href="https://teacup.p3k.io">https://teacup.p3k.io</a> and once you click the button it take you to the post
<p>if your site does not support micropub, the post are on teacup, not on your site
<p>If you login with a non-micropub site you get a profile on teacup, otherwise it links to your posts
<p>I also made this work on my pebble watch which is why it has buttons not type-in
<p>I'm making an indieweb-friendly silo, which is a big goal here

<p>I want to push from a Known homebase to Drupal website the way you can to twitter
<p>I would like to get Kkown to post to more than one twitter/fb/drupal site too as well
<p>I want to get Known to do everything that Buffer does but better
<p>posting from Known to a Drupal 8 site first, then working on making Drupal do what Known does

<p>because we have a growing adoption of indieweb sites and webmention, it is now a spam target
<p>the way it works is that if the webmention is not form an approved url, it sends a vouch url that connects you to the host
<p>if we want a vouch url we return http error 449 which msft made up which means "add a parameter"
