<h1>GigaOM Roadmap - live notes</h1>
<p><a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@jack'>Jack Dorsey</a>:  <blockquote><p>we don't just see it as payments, it's a continuum from what happens before to after. The receipt is part of that 
<p>offline commerce is still 90% of commerce - ecommerce is only about 10% so far. We still need to make that easier
<p>it's easy for companies to look at competition and react to that, but then you're on someone else's roadmap, not yours
<p>a lot of folks are building individual parts of payment, not connecting them together, so the merchant sees the seams
<p>Adding the Square reader to a phone gives it a superpower, do something new
<p>we learned a lot from sightglass - they still needed to take cash as well as cards, so we built a full PoS
<p>we can tell the merchant item level detail of what they sold when, not just prices. Like web analytics for retail
<p>we give access to all our information to every employee. Any meeting is required to take notes, get sent to all company
<p>if you enable people by sharing what is happening in meetings, they don't feel that they need to be invited
<p>we send the board meeting deck out to the entire company, 600 people have a copy of that
<p>if we do this right, we can create company that regenerates, that outlives any of our times there
<p>it's very hard to keep secrets - we built the structure of our office around this too - few conf rooms, lots of space

<a class='h-card' href='http://om.co/'>Om Malik</a>:  <blockquote><p>how do we make sure the rest of the tech industry think about how we make technology invisible?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@jack'>Jack Dorsey</a>:  <blockquote><p>the tool that has helped most has been visualising what we want to see in the world and then building up to it
<p>it's not about technology disappearing, it's about the way we want the world to work
<p>it's about breaking something big into very simple problems that we can solve in sequence while seeing the big vision
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://om.co/'>Om Malik</a>:  <blockquote><p>having patience is ok with your kind of profile and backing, but lots of startups are under pressure
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@jack'>Jack Dorsey</a>:  <blockquote><p>people said "your previous experience was in microblogging what you had for breakfast -how can you move money around?"

<a class='h-card' href='http://www.leilatakayama.org'>Leila</a>:  <blockquote><p>I want to understand how robots can live in our world rather than forcing us to live in a robotic world
<p>we built a robot that is almost human-sized, and moves around picking things up and moving them
<p>to build a robot you need mechanical engineers and programmers, but once people get involved we need sociologists too
<p>our robots can move around collecting empty coffee cups, folding towels, but they need to think very hard first
<p>we got a Pixar animator to help our robots to show emotional feedback to humans, if they're thinking or failing
<p>we need to set expectations for humans around the robots, so they'll catch an expensive robot if it falls off a table
<p>Henry Evans had a stroke, he's quadraplegic. He used our robot teleoperated to scratch his own face and shave himself
<p>our remote coworker Dallas used to be a voice in a plastic box, until we put a camera on a robot for him
<p>A lot of the people using our robots at the moment are universities - they're like mainframes now. We need startups

<a class='h-card' href='http://www.spiekermann.com/en/'>erik spiekermann</a>:  <blockquote><p>it might be arrogant to presume that people have seen what I do - some typeface Meta Sans, Economist Newtype
<p>I used to draw by hand with pen and ink - there were only 126 characters to a font then, not 600 like now
<p>Now there's drawing on screen which I'm lousy at , whcih si why I hire young designers who can do that for me
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://about.me/veen'>Jeffrey Veen</a>:  <blockquote><p>in 2009 we were finally able to do good type on the web- you were quick to embrace it with your huge collection
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.spiekermann.com/en/'>erik spiekermann</a>:  <blockquote><p>for me it was very obvious - you don't have to be a fan of the screen to see people reading onscreen
<p>It was obvious that it had to move in 2009 - Georgia+Helvetica are nice, but it's like eating dry bread + water
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://about.me/veen'>Jeffrey Veen</a>:  <blockquote><p>I remember making the pitch to VCs as type being ripe for disruption "people pay for the shapes of letters?"
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.spiekermann.com/en/'>erik spiekermann</a>:  <blockquote><p>I'd rather have the 10% of people who pay rather than 100% of the people who don't pay
<p>There is a human need to compose music, write books and to design typefaces
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://about.me/veen'>Jeffrey Veen</a>:  <blockquote><p>a lot of people don't see the nuances in the expressiveness of type. Why is that?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.spiekermann.com/en/'>erik spiekermann</a>:  <blockquote><p>You're not supposed to think about type - it's like water or air - if you notice it it's wrong
<p>why are there thousands of vineyards when you have white and red? Type is in the few percent improvement
<p>Whatever my shirt is in RGB I don't know, I'm an old print gut - it's 80% Cyan in CMYK
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://about.me/veen'>Jeffrey Veen</a>:  <blockquote><p>Erik, you said the typography in iOS7 is the folly of youth
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.spiekermann.com/en/'>erik spiekermann</a>:  <blockquote><p>In Clarkenwell everyone has discovered Helvetica like you discovered salt
<p>Everyone found you can reduce helvetica by 2 pixels. It's a beautiful typeface but it sucks for an interface
<p>whan you're a user interface designer you have to forget your vanity and think about the user
<p>when you're young you want to make a splash so you use a typeface to stand out, rather than for use
<p>what we do in typefaces is design the 5% - 95% is a given set of rules for what letter shapes look like
<p>it's almost like music - you have 8 notes in music - we design the sound of a word played with strings or brass
<p>if you're showing the world what a great designer you are, it will probably become illegible or get annoying
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://about.me/veen'>Jeffrey Veen</a>:  <blockquote><p>I enjoyed meeting type designers - there aren't a lot of them in the world
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.spiekermann.com/en/'>erik spiekermann</a>:  <blockquote><p>FontLab has about 2000 licensees, so there are that many. Full time ones maybe 200. It's incredibly boring.
<p>Making a typeface is tedious and incredibly boring - it takes a very long time to go from an idea to a typeface
<p>I sketch it out and then I have all these minions who work on the processes - I'm an art director
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://about.me/veen'>Jeffrey Veen</a>:  <blockquote><p>what we did with TypeKit was open up a much broader market with Wordpress Themes etc -very controversial
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.spiekermann.com/en/'>erik spiekermann</a>:  <blockquote><p>You don't buy a typeface, you buy a font - we have to adapt everything for print, screen and TV, which is worst
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://about.me/veen'>Jeffrey Veen</a>:  <blockquote><p>a lot of people feel insecure abut choosing wine in a restaurant, it's the same with choosing typefaces
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.spiekermann.com/en/'>erik spiekermann</a>:  <blockquote><p>in my office we have 60 people, and I go round and everyone ends up using the same typefaces as each other
<p>as you say, it's like spotify - you use what you've used before, and keep using more of it
<p>you wouldn't use the same images for every project, why would you use the same typeface?
<p>Does it need to be muscular or feminine? Does it need to work at small sizes and big? Cyrillic or Greek?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://about.me/veen'>Jeffrey Veen</a>:  <blockquote><p>its no secret in the design community that the second link in a search will be a bittorrent site for a typeface
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.spiekermann.com/en/'>erik spiekermann</a>:  <blockquote><p>I want everyone to have  typefaces, but if you've spent 100s of hours designing it, it would be nice to honoured
<p>of course no-one asked me to spend hundreds of hours designing the typeface in the first place...
<p>We're designing a typeface for Firefox that will be open sourced, and I'm in two minds
<p>my worry is that people will take it and mess it up and then I may get blamed for it
<p>If you write a pop song you can't sue people for singing it out of tune. Don't blame me for your design
<p>what we do as designers is interpret - we are the interface, making it easier for people to make it work
<p>computers and technology are complex. We don't make them simpler, we make them more complex for people
<p>I'm getting paid to make things look good. Isn't that fantastic?

<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://gotinder.com'>Sean Rad</a>:  <blockquote><p>We have a lot of frustrations with making new relationships. There's a lack of efficiency in meeting new people 
<p>you're either a hunter out there being rejected, or your being pursued and feeling overexposed
<p>when your friend in high school tells you that your crush also has a crush on you, that's what Tinder does
<p>we got the information right originally - tapping and waiting felt slow. Swiping felt faster
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://gigaom.com/cleantech/'>Katie Fehrenbacher</a>:  <blockquote><p>you went to great lengths to make it more female friendly - not a sausage fest
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://gotinder.com'>Sean Rad</a>:  <blockquote><p>we talked to women, and found that the guys that approach them are the creeps, not the good guys
<p>we're putting control back in the hands of women to decide who to interact with
<p>we wanted to make sure we were solving a core human issue. So we tested on college students
<p>the context of how you use these tools is  learned behaviour - we needed our users to show each other that
<p>It worked on a college campus where everyone has that shared context; expanding beyond that was harder
<p>everyone always says that problems of success are fun to have, but they're still hard and not that fun really.
<p>it's very worrying when you have everything to lose - you have prototype code so you're hanging by a thread
<p>If you create this double-opt-in relationship you can add a lot of efficiency to marketplaces [he still means dating]

<a class='h-card' href='http://om.co/'>Om Malik</a>:  <blockquote><p>I'm bummed out that you're doing this smoke alarm now that I've quit smoking
<p>you're designing things that have been left unloved for decades
<p>would you do locks? there are lot of locks on kickstarter
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://nest.com'>Tony Fadell</a>:  <blockquote><p>You have to have a smoke alarm and a thermostat; locks and sprinklers you don't have to have.
<p>you can buy one that just goes BEEP or you can have one that is well designed

<a class='h-card' href='http://om.co/'>Om Malik</a>:  <blockquote><p>How about a smoke alarm that plays Justin Bieber? Ringtones for smoke alarms!
<p>you should redesign the garage door opener next - that the most broken product I have

<a class='h-card' href='http://nest.com'>Tony Fadell</a>:  <blockquote><p>In hardware now there are a lot of blot together things now - you don't have to call motorola for a cpu
<p>you can learn with that open hardware model, but to build a true hardware product you do need a lot of money
<p>when you do something that si atoms based you need a lot of money and a lot of time before the first customer
<p>Kickstarter and indiegogo are kind of for making beta products - to go mass market takes a lot more
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://om.co/'>Om Malik</a>:  <blockquote><p>Apple started with great hardware and then layered software on top of it. What should you start with?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://nest.com'>Tony Fadell</a>:  <blockquote><p>you have to optimise all along the chain -you need to look at the cost of the device and include the service and apps
<p>I'm an old school guy - I need to know how I'm going to get to profitability sooner or later
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://om.co/'>Om Malik</a>:  <blockquote><p>a lot of these products don't seem fully network aware - not as part of the brain of the device
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://nest.com'>Tony Fadell</a>:  <blockquote><p>It reminds me of web 1.0 - it was like digital versions of magazines or albums. Internet of things is now 1.0
<p>Refrigerators with tablets on is Internet of Things 1.0 - they don't rethink the experience from top to bottom
<p>just because it can be connected doesn't mean it should. It should be reinvented *with* connection
<p>You need the right balance of rational and emotional features - Kahneman's thinking fast and slow model fits
<p>we started to see all kinds of data coming though the thermostat, and realised we could save them money
<p>these products aren't like cellphones that last 18 months - we have to create moments over 10 years
<p>Instagram created magical moments by adding filters - everyone said 'wow!' = emotional impact
<p>in 1999 I started a company no-one wanted to hear about hardware. Now they want to give me money
<p>there are so many more opportunities to be entrepreneurs now, but do work with your heroes first if you can

<p>think of indiegogo as a way to build on lean startup principles by giving you insight about your product
<p>VC can only give you a vote of confidence, they can't tell you where your market is. indiegogo can
<p>I can see people taking a hybrid approach to finance with indiegogo showing proof for venture/angel funders

<p>what happens when machines communicate with one another? Or with people?
<p>The future is about design, software and taking all the data the machines generate and making it useful
<p>you want a lot of information to happen in the background, without people being aware, and to be predictive
<p>"More technology is better but when you want to use it it has to be simpler" applies to the Industrial Internet

<p>In many cases we have the business model figured out - we have customers who want your design and code
<p>There is going to be more productivity - to change the kinds of jobs available
<p>one of our areas is hospital operations management - adding sensors and robots to hospitals to ease nurses' work
<p>sensors have been put in our technology over the last decade - customers need to track assets first
<p>a good thing about being in many industries is that we see trends across engineering, healthcare, aerospace etc
<p>We have a connected wall oven that you can pre-heat before you get home or check you turned it off
<p>We have things with Quirky - a net connected power strip so you can turn anything on and off remotely
