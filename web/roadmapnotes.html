<h1>GigaOM Roadmap - live notes</h1>
<p><a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@jack'>Jack Dorsey</a>:  <blockquote><p>we don't just see it as payments, it's a continuum from what happens before to after. The receipt is part of that 
<p>offline commerce is still 90% of commerce - ecommerce is only about 10% so far. We still need to make that easier
<p>it's easy for companies to look at competition and react to that, but then you're on someone else's roadmap, not yours
<p>a lot of folks are building individual parts of payment, not connecting them together, so the merchant sees the seams
<p>Adding the Square reader to a phone gives it a superpower, do something new
<p>we learned a lot from sightglass - they still needed to take cash as well as cards, so we built a full PoS
<p>we can tell the merchant item level detail of what they sold when, not just prices. Like web analytics for retail
<p>we give access to all our information to every employee. Any meeting is required to take notes, get sent to all company
<p>if you enable people by sharing what is happening in meetings, they don't feel that they need to be invited
<p>we send the board meeting deck out to the entire company, 600 people have a copy of that
<p>if we do this right, we can create company that regenerates, that outlives any of our times there
<p>it's very hard to keep secrets - we built the structure of our office around this too - few conf rooms, lots of space

<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@jack'>Jack Dorsey</a>:  <blockquote><p>the tool that has helped most has been visualising what we want to see in the world and then building up to it
<p>it's not about technology disappearing, it's about the way we want the world to work
<p>it's about breaking something big into very simple problems that we can solve in sequence while seeing the big vision

<a class='h-card' href='http://www.leilatakayama.org'>Leila</a>:  <blockquote><p>I want to understand how robots can live in our world rather than forcing us to live in a robotic world
<p>we built a robot that is almost human-sized, and moves around picking things up and moving them
<p>to build a robot you need mechanical engineers and programmers, but once people get involved we need sociologists too
<p>our robots can move around collecting empty coffee cups, folding towels, but they need to think very hard first
<p>we got a Pixar animator to help our robots to show emotional feedback to humans, if they're thinking or failing
<p>we need to set expectations for humans around the robots, so they'll catch an expensive robot if it falls off a table
<p>Henry Evans had a stroke, he's quadraplegic. He used our robot teleoperated to scratch his own face and shave himself
<p>our remote coworker Dallas used to be a voice in a plastic box, until we put a camera on a robot for him
<p>A lot of the people using our robots at the moment are universities - they're like mainframes now. We need startups
