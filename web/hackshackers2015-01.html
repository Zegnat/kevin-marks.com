<p><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://erinjo.is'>Erin Jo Richey</a>:  <blockquote><p>I built my first website in notepad. It was 1999, I'd just finished a powerpoint class and my dad wanted a website
<p>I made my own website shortly after - I include my college course and a blog and the rainbow gifs I liked at the time
<p>you should be your own platform because you desebve to control your own content
<p>rather than post to places like facebook or twitter, post to your own site and be your own platform
<p>when you are your own platform you have the freedom to choose and to change
<p>if you don't like your hosting company or your posting platform, you can change
<p>I know it is 2015, and you can't ignore social networks, but you deserve to have the original record
<p>social networks come and go -do you remember these? (shows ~50 that died)
<p>if you want to establish yourself as a writer, photographer, film-maker, be your own platform
<p>if you want to be paid or attract an audience, you owe it to yourself to be your own platform
<p>this is my platform: <a class="auto-link" href="http://erinjorichey.com">erinjorichey.com</a>

<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://thecreativeactionnetwork.com/'>C.A.N.</a>:  <blockquote><p>we set up site where anyone can contribute art, and anyone can publish it as shirt 
<p>you're saying "wait max, isn't crowdsourcing terrible?" we found not 
<p>constraints matter: don't give broad goals, give specific ones 
<p>be positive: call people by their name, have them participate, don't be like a machine
<p>have contests: but don't pick the one winner - we need a lot, not just one answer, so make sure al can see
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://louder.org'>Colin Mutchler</a>:  <blockquote><p>hands up if you really love ads? (not many hands) 37% of the internet have downloaded blocking software
<p>in 1999 I hated ads enough that I wrote on one on the subway, and got busted by the cops
<p>maybe a revolution did happen with help from these platforms, but did anything fundamentally changed?
<p>investors put money into facebook & twitter to make a return, so it shouldn't be surprising that we now see ads
<p>we are trying to remake advertising for good - we got an Occupy Wallstreet ad on Fox News
<p>to convince regular people to advertise, don't use the word, say "help this artist reach an audience" 
<p>frame advertising as a gift - his friend wants to give the gift of reach to Steve the artist - a human gift
<p>Will the internet survive? I'm not sure. if it is going to be different it is because humans fund attention

<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://alleyinteractive.com'>Austin Smith</a>:  <blockquote><p>Alley Interactive is a digital firm in NY - sorry
<p>even though New York is 3 hours ahead we're a year behind tech-wise
<p>publishers are protective of their audiences and want to engage with them directly
<p>don't try and get between the audience and the publisher  - media companies are wising up to this
<p>if you want a publisher to pay, solve their problem not readers' problems
<p>if building a product for journalists, make it open source - training journalist to operate CMS's is no fun
<p>journalist operate on a news cycle, the business people don't - journalist won't use it if they don't have a need
<p>to keep publishing clients, don't let content marketers use your software. At least rename it
<p>2 products news organisations want to buy: 1. Solve Web to Print
<p>no publisher is good at doing web first then print - everything doing this is some huge janky thing
<p>2nd ideafor publishers: Dsta managemnt and print subscriptions combined

<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://werd.io/'>Ben Werdmüller</a>: <a href="http://werd.io/2015/censorship-and-silos">summary of presentation</a> <blockquote><p>i work with <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/erinjo">@erinjo</a> on <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/withknown">@withknown</a> and we'll get on integrating indesign tomorrow
<p>recently a man in NY posted a photo of him kissing his husband on his wedding day, and instagram removed
<p>it's very easy to flag things as inappropriate on social networks - breastfeeding and drag queens every day
<p>when Mark Zuckerberg posted about Charlie Hebdo, many of the comments were marked inapproriate
<p>we've all heard of Snowden and the NSA, but we are all spying on each other as well
<p>the PEN American center reported that > 1/3 of writers in democratic countries self-censor because of NSA fears
<p>the cloud sounds fluffy, but it is actually someone else hard drive, and it can be easily deleted
<p>the internet was designed for resiliency - unlike the silos we pour content into now, it was decentralised
<p>what if we wer all service, we were all platforms, and stored our data on servers that we controlled
<p>what if our servers were in our living rooms and newsrooms?
<p>look at intel compute sticks and <a class="auto-link" href="http://sandstorm.io">sandstorm.io</a> as ways to store this
<p>there are other platforms too, like <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/withknown">@withknown</a> that <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/erinjo">@erinjo</a> and I work on
<p>back int he day Microsoft freed us by giving computers on our desks; our dat shoudl be ours too

<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://contextly.com'>Ryan Singel</a>:  <blockquote><p>At Contextly we think about evergreen stories a lot - stories that aren't just current
<p>an example from a publisher we work with - more than 40% of views went to content published before 2014
<p>we wrote a story about Silk Road, and I got notifications that it was a top ten story every day for years
<p>Mother Jones published a series of charst showing inequality in america, and it got more views than the Romney leak
<p>there are seasonal evergreen stories - valentines, st patricks day and xmas recipes
<p>there are also definitive stories that people refer to over time
<p>to identify evergreens - look at referrals over long timelines, but also talk to your staff
<p>evergreen stories are those that your community tells you that they are right for them
<p>NPR indentified their evergreen stories and share one very day between 3am and 6am
<p>publications should have an evergreen strategy
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href=''>q</a>:  <blockquote><p>we shoudl do evergreens and was told "ad team saysadvertisers hate that"
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://contextly.com'>Ryan Singel</a>:  <blockquote><p>you can use the evergreens to build audience, and can sell a package around valentines day when ad buyers show up
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href=''>q</a>:  <blockquote><p>having your own server? open source will get more usage? what?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://alleyinteractive.com'>Austin Smith</a>:  <blockquote><p>I'm talking about the journalist/biz/tech relationship at the company - selling that is hard; 
<p>journalists don't have buying power - give them an open source thing with a SaaS platform that helps them now
<p>businesses are about results - if journalists can say "lots of people came here for this, can we pay for it now?" 
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://werd.io/'>Ben Werdmüller</a>:  <blockquote><p>open source is a process as well as a licence - it's a way to involve your users more directly in your product
<p>we work with education a lot and they work with open source software too
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href=''>q</a>:  <blockquote><p>whenever I watch cable news we see lots of people funded by defence contractors; not by peace activists
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.thecreativeactionnetwork.com'>Max Slavkin</a>:  <blockquote><p>we got one artists on CNN ever, maybe we can get more over time
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://louder.org'>Colin Mutchler</a>:  <blockquote><p>what trends in media changes all the time - the #OscarsSoWhite tag today is an example; they force TV to talk
<p>if you do it with money it can go quicker. It depends on the issue and who owns the channel
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='q'>q</a>:  <blockquote><p>people switch from selling to journalist to selling to brands - is this a bad thing?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://alleyinteractive.com'>Austin Smith</a>:  <blockquote><p>brands have different needs from publishers so if you chase them you'll lose the publishers
<p>brands have an ultimate goal; publishers just want people to keep reading
<p>verizon built an undercover news site, but they wouldn't let journalists cover net neutrality
<p>I know this is weird from a new yorker but you need some shred of idealism to be in the news business, even in2015
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://matter.vc'>Corey Ford</a>:  <blockquote><p>do you have advice to publishers to be better customers for innovators?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://alleyinteractive.com'>Austin Smith</a>:  <blockquote><p>publishers need to have more money
<p>publishers and biz people pit themselves against their editorial staff. They need long-range perspective
<p>it's hard to ask a dying news media brand to take a long term perspective
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://erinjo.is'>Erin Jo Richey</a>:  <blockquote><p>our platform is open source and we'd very much like to have journalists and media companies working with us
<p>we are working with educators, and they like open source too, so we recognise the tension between use and sales
<p>a lot of people told us to talk to marketing and brands as they have money
