#xoxofest @dooce: the day that I realised that my child had been written into my contract. I had to walk away. 
#xoxofest @abexlumberg: I din't have any business experience before I got the job of CEO of my own company 
#xoxofest @abexlumberg: my last for-profit job before becomeing CEO was bagging groceries at a thriftway
#xoxofest @abexlumberg: I did this show for This American Life called The Giant Pool of Money on the economic crisis
#xoxofest @abexlumberg: The same tools we are using to tell stories about heartbreak and love we can talk about exotic financial derivatives
#xoxofest @abexlumberg: Planet Money became very successful - and showed that we could apply these skills across a range of stories
#xoxofest @abexlumberg: I thought "this podcast thing could work" - I thought I learned I was good at business through the t-shirt project
#xoxofest @abexlumberg: we made almost $600,000 and sold 25,000 t-shirts, so I thought "damn am I hot shit" - we're making money
#xoxofest @abexlumberg: I love NPR and public media, but they're not the best business people in the world. I thought I could do better
#xoxofest @abexlumberg: I thought the Startup podcast was going to be a publicity stunt, but it ended up as a suprisingly emotional journey
#xoxofest @abexlumberg: I went to pitch @sacca, which is like just learning to paint and asking Jeff Koons for help
#xoxofest @abexlumberg: why don't we use a foreign name, and we ended up in Esperanto - with 'Orello' - it's Ear in Esperanto
#xoxofest @abexlumberg:  the startup narrative often gets told in hindsight with all the bad bits cut out - I wanted to leave them in
#xoxofest @abexlumberg: when you are deciding how to share out ownership, you have to pretend you have a big valuable company when you don't
#xoxofest @abexlumberg: every time we put out an episode I thought people would turn on me and they'll realise that I'm an awful person
#xoxofest @abexlumberg: but every time we did share the pain other people told us "I went through that too!"
#xoxofest @abexlumberg: we ended up raising $1.5M in seed money and it wasonly  after the podcast went up we sealed the deal
#xoxofest @abexlumberg: I thought I could go on my track record, but nobody got it. When I did it and it got attention it became an example
#xoxofest @abexlumberg: I was explaining how I was going to make a narrative with pathos, and then I did it
#xoxofest @abexlumberg: You are never going to able to explain the thing as well as you can by showing the thing
#xoxofest @abexlumberg: Our revenue in the 1st year was $2m thanks to insanely high ad rates, but after @dooce's talk we need another stream
#xoxofest @abexlumberg: a year into it I am seeing things happen that I had no idea would happen. @PJVogt and @Agoldmund came in early
#xoxofest @abexlumberg: they kept coming up with new credits for Matt "Matt Lieber is a window in room where you didn't think there was one"
#xoxofest @abexlumberg: [plays the beginning of https://gimletmedia.com/episode/36-todays-the-day/ ] which is a great 4th wall breaking episode
#xoxofest @abexlumberg: the reason we're all trying to start things is to make a place where things we hadn't imagined can grow
#xoxofest @waxpancake: our next speaker is a force in Indie comics - C Spike Trotman
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: you heard about million dollar podcasts and million follower mommy blogs, it's time to think small again
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: like a lot people, I say "I don't know what I'm doing" when I'm asked what i do, and people agree with me
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: the 1990s were the high water mark for comics, but all but one distributor collapsed 
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: there was a boom in independent comics - independent is anything that isn't a guy in spandex with visible muscles
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: but the one remaining distributor raised the minimum order size and wiped out all the indie comics
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: but then webcomics happened, and the bar to entry went from very hight to really low
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: when webcomics took off we were seen as line-jumpers, dilletantes, ushering in the death of the newspaper
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: it felt kind of like trench warfare with webcomics and traditional publishing in separate lines
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: and after years of trench warfare Kickstarter showed up and I thought "this is going to be amazing"
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: I did a book a book called "poorcraft" based on how to get by when you are poor, 'cos with webcomics I knew about it
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: people said "anyone who can raise $13,000 on kickstarter shouldn't be using kickstarter"
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: I called it Iron Circus Comics because I already owned the domain,  and it was better than Invincible Dachshund 
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: If you search for me on the internet you'll find my women's erotic comics anthology, Smut Peddler
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: I thought "I like porn, I don't like any of the porn being made. Oh, I should make some porn"
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: to be in Smut Peddler your comic needs to stress consent and mutual willingness. You'd think that was a low bar, butâ€¦
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: to be in Smut Peddler there needs to be a woman involved - the writer, the artist or the colourist
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: I got so much pushback on the woman thing, though I also got lots of creepy letters about the consent thing too
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: Wow, I sure do sell a whole lot of stuff nobody wants. 
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: Kickstarter then had the 'message the author' button right next to the "report this" one, so I got some odd messages
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: This started a lot on kickstarter - this opened up the floodgates for support for other things
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: I'm really into artists getting paid. You'd think that would be obvious, but not so
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: I want to put things out there that I don't see - that I'm told people don't want.
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: A New World is about your adventure being someone else's disaster
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: there is a group that think their TV and comics and games ae under threat from people not like them
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: there have always been black people and brown people and women and queers and trans in comics, we've always been here
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: this is not a fight. It's over. We're here, we've always been here. if you have a problem with it I don't really care
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: Comics was comfortable. Superhero stories in comic book shops and movies about men in tights is not all there is
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: the goalposts for unprofessional keep moving all the time "that will never work" becomes "that doesn't count"
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: You can sit on reddit or tumblr and say that my comics don't count, but you are literally, verifiably wrong
#xoxofest @waxpancake: [standing ovation for @Iron_Spike] - I love it when that happens
