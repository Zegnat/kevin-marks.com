#indieweb @t: there are a lot of standards being developed outside the core standards bodies like IETF and w3c - like whatwg
#indieweb @brianbehlendorf: Apache got fed up with w3c process a while ago. Trouble is that nobody changes their mind in public any more
#indieweb @brianbehlendorf: if you can talk with people in person you can often change their minds and then have it formally reflected
#indieweb @brianbehlendorf: I tried to implement OpenID at ostpc.gov - if you used Yahoo's OpenID you got a horrible ugly url
#indieweb @brianbehlendorf: I view the ability to have private communications between individuals as a human right - end to end encryption
#indieweb @t: can we ensure that privacy against people who have nuclear weapons? 
#indieweb Jason: I can give them a run for their money
#indieweb Jason: "think of security as like a block of swiss cheese - you don't want those holes to line up and make a path through"
#indieweb @t: I want to harden myself to a reasonable level of security, but not form state-level actors
#indieweb @iboxifoo: I worry about the silos creating attractive pools of data that is worth hacking
#indieweb @brianbehlendorf: the NTP amplification attack last week meant that NTP daemons could be used to DDoS others
#indieweb @t: we care less about use of resources than compromising our private data
#indieweb @t: we want to be abel to send and host private messages peer to peer without them being compromised
#indieweb @brianbehlendorf: if you want to host an email server you want to make sure you aren't on a host that has been blacklisted before
#indieweb @t: email is not hackable in the good sense- you can't set it up yourself and hack it
#indieweb @brianbehlendorf: one problem with indieweb is that we don't have an end to end internet any more
#indieweb @t: we're not trying to reinvent DNS - we assume that works and we'll use it. Lets solve other problems first
#indieweb @t: the big problems are mostly UI and not plumbing - that is what holds back the indieweb. Solve UI first
#indieweb @t: my whole site is set up on flat files, I don't even use a database - I don't need to remember some bizarro mysql password
#indieweb @brianbehlendorf: I love that tantek and I are fetishizing different bits of the stack - I like mail, he likes files
#indieweb @t: I can't trust those [email] specs because there aren't test suites for them, unlike HTTP and SSL and HTML
#indieweb @t: we are trying to solve SSL certs for indieweb, but it is still hard
#indieweb @t: we have instructions for ssl on various different hosting services: http://indiewebcamp.com/https
#indieweb @iboxifoo: I've been using Soveriegn which is a set of scripts to configure a VPN to host things for you
#indieweb @iboxifoo: I like the parallel from the Homebrew Computer Club - it took a while to get things working for them
#indieweb @t: the original Homebrew Computing Club didn't have the knowledge sharing mechanisms we get to use easily
#indieweb @brianbehlendorf: what if most of us got our sustenance from McDonalds, Taco Bell, Subway - we'd lose something. We want kitchens
#indieweb @t: it's good that McDonalds are serving unhealthy food, because it gives us a reason to go indie.
#indieweb @t: If McDonalds could actually serve a full organic paleo meal then it would be more problmeatic
#indieweb @brianbehlendorf: did you know the US Postal Service was created before the revolution so they could communicate without the crown
