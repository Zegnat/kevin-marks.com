#iiw @IdentityWoman: Welcome to IIW - we have a special guest keynote today
#iiw @windley: A couple of months ago at BYU @dsearls gave an opening talk, and that set the tone for the unconference -that worked
#iiw @windley: 12 years ago Kim Cameron of Microsoft defined the 12 laws of identity - I asked him to talk and update these laws
#iiw @Kim_Cameron: It's intimidating to be here with so many people who are key to my understanding of identity
#iiw @Kim_Cameron: The laws of identity weren't written by me but by a whole group of us https://www.identityblog.com/?p=352
#iiw @Kim_Cameron: the goal was to codify what I know by identityâ€”Doc had just introduced me to the web through blogging, so I used my blog
#iiw @Kim_Cameron: at the time the world of identity was fragmented and talking on a blog helped have a conversation in public #indieweb
#iiw @Kim_Cameron: The internet was built without an identity system which is like building a house without plumbing
#iiw @Kim_Cameron: the internet was a patchwork quilt of identity one-offs - everyone went to their basement and hacked things up
#iiw @Kim_Cameron: at the same time the criminalisation of the internet was a huge growth industry
#iiw @Kim_Cameron: It was also clear that there wasn't a single identity panacea 
#iiw @Kim_Cameron: we wanted to have identity for the whole internet, not just for a Facebook, a Google  a Microsoft
#iiw @Kim_Cameron: So it had to be a metasystem, not a system; it had to incorporate previous systems
#iiw @Kim_Cameron: So we talked about "claims" - as opposed to the previous model of "assertions" that applied to a domain
#iiw @Kim_Cameron: the problem of determining what claims you believed was an important one
#iiw @Kim_Cameron: You can't just say you'll accept what identity providers say, you have to have of model of belief
#iiw @Kim_Cameron: All of the world works on claims now, which were baked into SAML and OpenID connect and so on
#iiw @Kim_Cameron: a digital subject is a person or thing in the digital world that is being dealt with
#iiw @Kim_Cameron: a digital identity is a set of claims made by one digital subject about itself or other digital subjects
#iiw @Kim_Cameron: self asserted claims are important - that is the basis of sovereign identity
#iiw @Kim_Cameron: I hate the past and ignore the present I live in the architectural conditional
#iiw @Kim_Cameron: I started as a physicist, so I propose laws with the goal of testing them to see if they apply
#iiw @Kim_Cameron: the 1st law we put forward was User control and consent - not drive by  actors in the sky but users
#iiw @Kim_Cameron: 2nd law was minimal disclosure for constrained use - not splattering your information everywhere for everything
#iiw @Kim_Cameron: you just release what you need to do a transaction, not everything about you
#iiw @Kim_Cameron: 3rd principle was justifiable parties to a transaction - only include parties that need to be there
#iiw @Kim_Cameron: 4th principle: directed identity - don't use universal identifiers for a specific transaction
#iiw @Kim_Cameron: 5th law is pluralism of operators and technologies - interact via claims to bridge both
#iiw @Kim_Cameron: 6th law is Human Integration - be aware that humans are part of the system - people have protocols too; relate to them
#iiw @Kim_Cameron: 7th law is Consistent experience across contexts - if every site works differently the users won't know how to use it
#iiw @Kim_Cameron: what I do on my website should not be connected to what I do professionally, or to my credit cards
#iiw @Kim_Cameron: My sympathies with the armed forces who are forced to use their social security numbers as their service numbers
#iiw @Kim_Cameron: combining information with a common key like a SSN violates lots of laws of identity at once
#iiw @Kim_Cameron: the big mistake I made was not understanding the asymmetric power of the parties
#iiw @Kim_Cameron: the user, the identity provider and the relying party (service provider) have different power dynamics
#iiw @Kim_Cameron: we had an idea of identity cards to choose from so that they can use their personal or business identities
#iiw @Kim_Cameron: Google has done a good job of making this model work for logging in
#iiw @Kim_Cameron: The Relying parties were busy counting clicks, and they didn't want to add one to log in remotely
#iiw @Kim_Cameron: I hadn't understood how much control the Relying Parties had over the expereince of the users
#iiw @Kim_Cameron: the 2nd thing I didn't understand was the multiplicity of the sources of claims - not single identity providers
#iiw @Kim_Cameron: the relying parties want lots of different claims from many different sources - user, location, own systems
#iiw @Kim_Cameron: they may want claims from attribute verifiers; they may want to send claims out to other systems
#iiw @Kim_Cameron: both identity providers and relying parties need relationship management - arbitrating claims between providers
#iiw @Kim_Cameron: the relying party needs someone to manage their relationships; equally important is managing it for the individual user
#iiw @Kim_Cameron: I mentioned the relying parties first because they have all the power, but we need to care about the user experience too
#iiw @Kim_Cameron: the level of complexity brought about by criminalisation is too high, so we need specialists
#iiw @Kim_Cameron: I expect there to be Personal Identity Managers to be run on behalf of users
#iiw @Kim_Cameron: because of the need for specialisation there will be concentration of systems for relying parties and for users
#iiw @Kim_Cameron: hopefully these systems will be content-free - not using their concntration to prevent innovation
#iiw @Kim_Cameron: this concentration creates a huge danger
#iiw @Kim_Cameron: decentralisation is a great counterforce to this
#iiw @Kim_Cameron: I'm encouraged by blockchain as the operator is disposable  - you  don't have to take the word of some VP
#iiw @nobantu: This unconference process realising that most of the interesting things at a conference happen outside formal talks
#iiw @kevinmarks: I'm doing a session on Intro to the indieweb, and how Micropub and webmention are being standardised
#iiw @dsearls: I want to talk about #CHEDDAR the successor to do not track, taking ad blocking into account
#iiw @ChristopherA: I am deeply involved with blockchain but it is definitely overhyped. 
#iiw @ChristopherA: We really don't want to put identity on the blockchain
#iiw @ChristopherA: bitcoin is a permissionless system - no-one can stop you mining or transacting
#iiw @ChristopherA: on the permissioned side there are different groups that need permission for certain roles
#iiw Maria Vachna: the different consensus protocols are about who gets to be the leader: PAXOS, POET etc - blockchain it's mining
#iiw @ChristopherA: what I need to know to suggest a consensus algorithm depends on the roles and number of players
#iiw Maria Vachna: if scale is locked in at the beginning, what happens when you mis-estimate it?
#iiw @ChristopherA: if just you and I have a transaction, there's no reason to use a blockchain
#iiw Joaquin: Under your research, what did you find that blockchain wasn't suitable for?
#iiw John W: There are use cases for things that need to expire - must go away after 7 years - blockchain is too persistent
#iiw Maria Vachna: our identities do change, and we don't always want them to persist -think of refugees fleeing persecution
#iiw @ChristopherA: there may be existing signing agencies, trust agencies that you would prefer to the blockchain
#iiw John W: if one of the requirements is compliance with the right to be forgotten or deleted, a persistent history is bad
#iiw John W: if information has to be revocable, that doesn't imply that it will delete all copies
#iiw Shen: You could use blockchain for key distribution and unique identifiers, not for storing volatile information
#iiw Maria Vachna: if a database solves it, we don't need to be told about this - what new ideas are there?
#iiw ?: a blockchain identity is first come, first based - bankers say you can't fix a mistake or reverse a transaction
#iiw ?: a secure blockchain needs a very high amount of traffic - it may go away if there is too much bickering
#iiw Dale: Bitcoin is based on a proof of work that is hard to game, but the work provides no value in the world. Is there one that does?
#iiw Shen: Blockstack's system is blockchain agnostic - it can work on bitcoin or other chains
#iiw Shen: you don't necessarily want work that is useful, as that makes it more gamable
#iiw @ChristopherA: blockchain can't do small trust - other things are a lot easier. 
#iiw @ChristopherA: zero-knowledge proofs can do a lot that don't require blockchain
#iiw John W: you can't use blockchain for ephemeral trust the same way that you can with OTR
#iiw Jack: where rely on an oracle you can't use blockchain as it adds an external dependency
#iiw Jack: say I have a website and I want future blocks to depend on that site - if that is removed blocks can't be validated
#iiw @ChristopherA: we understand problems with very large like bitcoin and things under 50 where paxos works but there are edges
#iiw @ChristopherA: anything with latency requriements doesn't work on blockchain
#iiw Jason: do you rely on immutable ledger or consensus protocol? You could have a triple-signed receipt to reveal proof
#iiw @ChristopherA: if you need to revert a transaction a year ago, you can't
#iiw @kevinmarks: you can revert by creating a mirror transaction but it leaves a record.
#iiw @ChristopherA: if you are logging a history, you can do things like certificate transparency rather than a blockchain.
#iiw Jack: turing complete computation is not necessary for the blockchain, but you can just log the verification
#iiw Jim Fenton: reading the board I see that blockchain is not good for small, trust, medium trust or large trust
#iiw John Best: I work with ledgers all the time, and a big issue is converting from one to another
#iiw John Best: if you take it from a go forward basis, migrating onto a blockchain means you don't have a creation history
#iiw John W: I have seen the size of storage be an issue so I am worried about the ever-growing size of the chain
#iiw @ChristopherA: with Segregated Witness we are moving the signatures away from the transactions to use less data
#iiw @ChristopherA: there are models where you mark a point in time and forget everything before that and move on
#iiw @ChristopherA: the root of this capability is to have a ledger; if you have something done with a ledger it might be a candidate
#iiw Jason: if you have a distributed consensus you could just store hashes
#iiw @ChristopherA: there are a lot of things implied by identity that don't belong on the blockchain
#iiw @ChristopherA: we're working to making sure that you can't put anything human readable in the blockchain itself
#iiw Drummond Reed: there are different kinds of blockchains that have different properties
#iiw Ryan Shea: you could replicate ICANN in blockchain by having a federated namespace that you delegate through for domains
#iiw Jack: what we are getting at here is the blockchain microkernel - what is the minimal thing we need for the blockchain to exist
#iiw Jack: I carea bout how big blocks are and how fast they propagate, and the federation model; we can simulate anything else
#iiw @ChristopherA: other forms of leader election have problems when the parties are changing a lot - eg Stellar is vulnerable to changes
#iiw John W: if you roll your own encryption it's usually a bad idea; is the same true of a blockchain
#iiw Andy: last iiw the argument was blockchains was for everything, now we're seeing scepticism which is interesting
#iiw Maria Vachna: that was why I proposed this
#iiw Andy: What are the things that you can get with the blockchain that other tools provide
#iiw @ChristopherA: don't be on the bleeding edge of blockchain; there are lots of things you can do without that
#iiw @ChristopherA: with 8 parties you could ahave a round robin consensus model and still have a blockchain ledger
#iiw @ChristopherA: if someone comes up with something better than proof of work we'll shift over
#iiw @kevinmarks: Blockchain is not provably collusion resistant - the 2013 fork resolution was solved by collusion
#iiw Joaquin: is blockchain resistant to bad implementations?
#iiw @ChristopherA: there's 7 billion dollars of reward if you can crack bitcoin
#iiw @kevinmarks: well, there's the ability destroy 7 biillion dollars if you crack bitcoin; you don't get them
#iiw @ChristopherA: bitcoin is arguably antifragile as it absorbs a lot of attacks
#iiw Ryan Shea: what blockchains are bad at is like what databases are bad at - they need to be part of a system.
#iiw Ryan Shea: some people have talked about storing data in the blockchain - that has always been a bad idea
#iiw @ChristopherA: there are things created in blockchain that don't have to be used in it - multisig and hd signature are examples
#iiw @ChristopherA: Merkle Trees are cool
