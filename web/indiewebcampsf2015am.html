<p>we're here to hack on our own websites and hope to build something to show off at the end of today
<p>if you're curious what to work on, start with your personal website, and what the next important thing you want to do to it
<p>you will find people here have similar itches about their sites, and may already have things for you to use on yours
<p>we do have a code of conduct - if you have issues contact me, kyle or andi <a class="auto-link" href="http://indiewebcamp.com/code_of_conduct">http://indiewebcamp.com/code_of_conduct</a>
<p>next we are going to spend 30 minutes for people to show their own websites, what they have working, and what they want to fix

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://snarfed.org/'>Ryan Barrett</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I'm Ryan Barrett, my website is <a class="auto-link" href="https://snarfed.org/">https://snarfed.org/</a> It's wordpress and does the indieweb stuff. I made <a class="auto-link" href="http://brid.gy">brid.gy</a>
<p>my raison d'être fro being here is interacting with the silos - <a class="auto-link" href="http://brid.gy">brid.gy</a> is the site that sends likes, retweets, etc 
<p>granary is a python library that si lower level to let you interatc wiht the silos
<p>silo.pub is kyles site that lets you publish to the silos and that is important too
<p>stats on <a class="auto-link" href="http://brid.gy">brid.gy</a> we have growth in listen, publish and blog webmentions, wiht listen being the biggest
<p>if you are on blogger, tumblr or wordpress you can use bridgy to post webmention to you as comments
<p>we have sent over 250,000 webmentions to about 850 sites
<p>users by silo: twitter is at the top, then facebook, the others have lower growth 
<p>whats surprising is that google+ is 3rd - who knew? I worked there for 10 years and wouldn't have known that
<p>we have multiple CMSs - Known <a class="auto-link" href="http://withknown.com">withknown.com</a> wordpress plugins, hosted wordpress and so on
<p>we have POSSE, backfeed, we have readers: woodwind, monocle - mentions, tagging notifications
<p>a lot of great stuff has happened - what should we do next? social graph, recommendations, driving growth
<p>The next big thing we want to work on is using your phone - they have surpassed computers
<p>we can read OK on phones, but posting on your phone is still hard - thats what I'd like to see get built

<p>If a site doesn't provide microformats markup, hovercards just show a small preview of the site.
