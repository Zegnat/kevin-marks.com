<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>welcome to the homebrew website club, May the 4th Be With You edition!
<p><a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/aaronpk">@aaronpk</a> has published a new version of the W3C Micropub spec: <a class="auto-link" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/WD-micropub-20160504/">https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/WD-micropub-20160504/</a>. now 3 impls that Delete and Update
<p>
<p>Webmention spec has reached 0 open issues, is basically ready to go from Working Draft to Candidate Recommendation
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://known.npdoty.name'>Nick Doty</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I wanted to ask about doing a security review of the Webmention spec
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://werd.io/'>Ben Werdmüller</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>2 things. the first, every single page of my site now has the meta http-equiv tag version of the HTTP response codes.
<p>Another I'm sort of playing with, some people don't want to have a blog, just want a page about them...
<p>So I'm kinda working on a little version of a single page generator that helps you set it up, also gives you a zip.
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://known.npdoty.name'>Nick Doty</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>What's the reasoning behind the http-equiv stuff? <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/benwerd">@benwerd</a>: means static sites are not penalized in webmention protocol
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>A lot of people have static hosting like GitHub pages, which makes it hard to do things like return "410 GONE" for deletes
<p>There's no standard way to statically archive a page's return code. The more I'm thinking about it,maybe incl all the headers
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://known.npdoty.name'>Nick Doty</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>The last couple of days, I've been thinking about ephemerality, in particular ephemerality of a URL.
<p>I do a lot of academic writing; I want to share my writing of incomplete drafts that are not ready to be public
<p>So it would be useful to have a URL that is only valid for some period of time, e.g. 1 hour.
<p> Implemented in a little php, I can now change the URL to include /until-730pm, and that will give back a new short URL
<p>So for example, this URL will only work for the next 15 minutes <a class="auto-link" href="https://npdoty.name/u/cudo">https://npdoty.name/u/cudo</a> 
<p>(in re: what if someone archives the final URL?) it's a privacy rather than a security measure, wouldnt share w attacker
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>one challenge, I can't tell from looking at the page that it isn't meant to be public
<p></blockquote></div>
<p><div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://known.npdoty.name'>Nick Doty</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>how about URL that says you can archive the URL, but it will only work for the next hour
<p>so I make a new short url with some random address like <a class="auto-link" href="https://npdoty.name/u/cudo">https://npdoty.name/u/cudo</a> that will expire in 15 minutes
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://werd.io/'>Ben Werdmüller</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>so if someone resolves the short url they can get to the content?
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://known.npdoty.name'>Nick Doty</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>yes, so if I trust you but I want it to go away in time form the irc, then I can use this
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://dariusdunlap.com'>Darius Dunlap</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>but if I instapaper it, then it gets sent to <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/pinboard">@pinboard</a>, so it it archived further
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://kylewm.com'>Kyle Mahan</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>this is like Flickr guest passes - a short term bypass of a login
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://known.npdoty.name'>Nick Doty</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>if I give out a capability URL like this, then you still have the abiilty to resolve it
<p>I do a 307 which is supposed to be temporary redirect, not sue how that differs from 302
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I was hacking in a bar with <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/benwerd">@benwerd</a> to get deleted working - I added a dt-deleted date to hide the post
<p>what I realised was that I can set the deleted date in the future so it would vanish like an indie snapchat
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://known.npdoty.name'>Nick Doty</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>is it a proper delete? if there's ever a timezone bug will it reappear.
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>do I want to set the delete time to 0, or do I want to set a deleted date so I can undo it
<p>expiring content is useful - it doesn't look like noise in your stream later - like future bar plans
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://dariusdunlap.com'>Darius Dunlap</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>you  might have a need where you want to send it out to certain people but only to you afterwards
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://kevinmarks.com'>Kevin Marks</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>you could also set the published time in the future to create ephemeral posts
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>you could also use this for a deadman switch style post that appears after a  time
<p>should you block search engines from ephemeral posts?
<p>for stuff that is short term you block search engines, if it's longterm you  may want more
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://known.npdoty.name'>Nick Doty</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>is there a way to tell google that it is volatile? There is a change frequency notation
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>if you delete a post and put a tombstone in your feed, how long do you leave it up there? 24 hours? longer
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://known.npdoty.name'>Nick Doty</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>email already have expiry headers - not sure anyone uses it
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://kevinmarks.com'>Kevin Marks</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>webpages have cache expiry timestamps as well
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://kylewm.com'>Kyle Mahan</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I really like the mute function on twitter but I forget to unmute people whoa re bing noisy for an hour
<p>so I made quiettime.xyz and I put in <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/kevinmarks">@kevinmarks</a> because he is tweeting too much right now
<p>and it mutes him for an hour
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://newgov.us'>Britt Blaser</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I'm building  a tool to help you manage politicians
<p>politicians are very sensitive to constitutents, so we have a mapping from jurisdictions to a string
<p>so you can make a post that refers to your political constituencies without identifying you
<p>if a politician discovers a constituent cares about the issue, they care instantly
<p>because congressional committees specialise, if you can connect with constituents of the members you can connect
<p>so we create a set of map polygons that are the intersections of the constituency boundaries
<p>I had to draw a boxes an arrows diagram to understand this - I want to see if people want this represented
<p>if you go to <a class="auto-link" href="http://newgov.net/demomap/index.html">http://newgov.net/demomap/index.html</a> you can find the powerzone for your address
<p>politicians love twitter because it lets them be broadcasters, we could give a backchannel that points to constituencies
<p>if we have your address, we can get the latlong, and then resolve to a constituency powerzone string
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://werd.io/'>Ben Werdmüller</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>you could also make this use indieauth to connect your website with your location zone
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://newgov.us'>Britt Blaser</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>so far it's been impossible to be effective politically without exposing your address
<p>every local secretary of state maintains the voter file of addresses of registered voters and party affiliation
<p>instead of the politicians being the owner of the district, theya re the agent of the voter
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@ZoeSchiffer'>Zoe Schiffer</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>do constituents get to see this feedback?
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://newgov.us'>Britt Blaser</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>we could aggregate this for the constituents as well as the politicians - so they are tracking numbers too
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://kevinmarks.com'>Kevin Marks</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>a previous thought along these lines: <a class="auto-link" href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2002/08/blogthevote2002usa.html">http://epeus.blogspot.com/2002/08/blogthevote2002usa.html</a>

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I have a small demo that is only working on my laptop - this is a deleted post on my site
<p>if you delete a post you shouls probably delete a slug - the part of the url that has words from the post
<p>so the slug should not be part of the unique identifier
<p>if you want to implement a deleted post
<p>Also, this weekend is the second Indiewebcamp Dusseldorf, which has about 60 people coming
<p>the 6th annual indieweb summit in portland is at <a class="auto-link" href="http://2016.indieweb.org">2016.indieweb.org</a> - buy a ticket for $5 or send an indie RSVP for free
<p>we also have a $1000 fund from an anonymous donor to fund underrepresented  groups to come<p></blockquote></div>
