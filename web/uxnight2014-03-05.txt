#uxnight @andigalpern: welcome everyone - we are recording so there will be a link later
#uxnight @andigalpern: UX Night happens on the first or third wednesday every month - organised by CascadeSF
#uxnight @andigalpern: here is a story about 2 nerdsâ€¦ @mdo+@smiley: that's us!
#uxnight @andigalpern: Mr Jonathan Smiley @smiley moved from Birmingham, AL to SF to work at ZURB in Sept 2008
#uxnight @andigalpern: He met @mdo and a friendship was born, but mark left in 2010 to work at twitter on Bootstrap
#uxnight @andigalpern: August 2011 Boostrap was launched by @mdo + @fat, November 2011 Foundation launched by @smiley
#uxnight @smiley: A framework is patterns and best practices and shortcuts to get you to do things quickly
#uxnight @mdo: they're patterns and templates  we do all the grunt work so you don't have to
#uxnight @andigalpern: Paul Boag said the purpose of a framework was a pattern library to ensure design consistency
#uxnight @mdo: there's one called TukTuk, they claim to be not bootstrap
#uxnight @mdo: there's one called Ratchet - Jacob and COnner made that too
#uxnight @mdo: we did a lot of work for clients of different sizes, so we made style guides, 1st in photoshop, then html+css
#uxnight @mdo: the inspiration for zurb style guide was a gnereal template for all the client code
#uxnight @andigalpern: so a framework is a style guide?
#uxnight @smiley: Foundation came about from style guides for each client, starting with a barebones grid
#uxnight @smiley: after a while we saw every client needed similar things
#uxnight @smiley: the advantage of giving clinets style guides is that it empowers them to build things themselves without you
#uxnight @smiley: we decided to abstract the Zurb style guide , so it was fully general. Foundation 5.2 is out today
#uxnight @andigalpern: if you want to get in a better mood, go to the bootstrap blog which has a 90s dance party for each release
#uxnight @andigalpern: if I wanted to design my own framework what would I do?
#uxnight @smiley: don't design your own. it's a cool coding exercise but it's a lot of work. existing ones are sophisticted
#uxnight @smiley: figure out the things you use repeatedly, that there are lots of, and do them in the best way possible
#uxnight @smiley: when you design something you need to be opinionated, and people will fuck you up about it
#uxnight @andigalpern: if you're doing a style guide and list of patterns - what then?
#uxnight @mdo: both Bootstrap and Foundation will let you decide which bit to strip out for  style guide
#uxnight @mdo: you make some grids, buttons, forms and table styles and off you go, but testing it on lots of devices is hard
#uxnight @mdo: you can fork bootstrap and foundation as they are both MIT licencsed
#uxnight @smiley: there are a lot of companies that now release their styleguides - mailchimp has one
#uxnight @andigalpern: what happened with LESS? Is that still part of bootstrap?
#uxnight @mdo: When I started out I used LESS because I didn't know what a gem was so couldn't use SASS
#uxnight @mdo: LESS is basically on par since SASS. there is a SASS port for bootstrap now
#uxnight @mdo: I work in github where everythign is SASS, but the rest of the day is LESS for bootstrap
#uxnight @smiley: we rebuilt foundation ins SASS for Foundation 3, and ZURB has always been a rails shop so gems weren't a problem
#uxnight @smiley: we've always used SASS, I've never used LESS so they seem pretty similar
#uxnight @mdo: LESS and SASS have their own opinions; eventually this should go into CSS itself
#uxnight @smiley: that would be preferable to move all this into CSS - lets pretend CSS working group could get it done
#uxnight @smiley: pros and cons - pros there's a lot you don't have to do, as someone has done it 
#uxnight @smiley: it'll take care of grid and responsiveness and javascript - you don't need to know a lot of javascript if you use one
#uxnight @smiley: you don't have to QA as much in a framework; you can rely on stuff working in any browser
#uxnight @smiley: the reason we made foundation was they we would spend hours on QA, and the framework learned
#uxnight @smiley: this was 5 years ago, so we had to use IE6 and IE7 so it was a world of pain
#uxnight @mdo: the other thing about grameworks is that end up really well documented - what you can do, and importantly what you can't do
#uxnight @mdo: the cons: it's easy to get stuck in what other people are doing, the same thing over and over
#uxnight @mdo: it's easy to not get to the point where you do something new on top
#uxnight @mdo: you may find that the team on the framework doesn't want to do what you want
#uxnight @smiley: you get a lot of stuff for free, but you only get what the framework wants to give you
#uxnight @mdo: there are also a lot of extensions and plugins for the frameworks too
#uxnight @andigalpern: is there a way to develop these so that it is easy to upgrade to the next version without breaking templates
#uxnight @smiley: things change from version to version, especially with a major version number
#uxnight @smiley: we make decisions that are supposed to work for a while
#uxnight @smiley: in Foundation 4 we removed Tabs and made them into sections that were tab/accordions 
#uxnight @smiley: in foundation 5 we reinstituted tabs and accordions, and broke all your sections, so sorry about that
#uxnight @mdo: bootstrap is used for a lot of internal sites but it is now being used in production too
#uxnight @mdo: the web moves fast and slow at the same time. we have to break some things now and then
#uxnight @mdo: we're not having to work on IE6 any more; foundation doesn't support IE8, and we'll drop that next
#uxnight @smiley: we run into this all the time - "we just built our website on foundation 4, how do we upgrade?" Don't
#uxnight @smiley: You cna do the big new cool thing, and in all likelihood screw your product and company
#uxnight @mdo: you cab upgrade point releases easily, but don't do major versions
#uxnight @mdo: The big jumps we're going to break things so that we can stay sane. Save it for your next thing
#uxnight @smiley: we have things at zurb still on foundation 0.8 - you don't need to migrate everything
#uxnight @mdo: we don't do usability studies directly on bootstrap. we get feedback on twitter and hacker news. HN we can leave
#uxnight @mdo: we have 13,000 issues on github that have been fixed, so we get feedback
#uxnight @mdo: we have a private repo for our next version, and we migrate issues from 3 to 4 when we see it
#uxnight @smiley: anybody who works on these frameworks is an egomaniacal control freak bastard. We're opinionated
#uxnight @smiley: we can tell people who have good reasoning
#uxnight @mdo: if you see the same thing reported several times, that's a clue. The crowd mentality works
#uxnight @mdo: the hard part of open source is that you show everyone what you're thinking
#uxnight @mdo: i find that I piss people off easily, so can I apologise to the entire internet now in advance
#uxnight @smiley: there are times when someone has a great idea, but it would fit Pure better than bootstrap
#uxnight @mdo: Jacob did a great talk on what is open source and why do I feel so guilty
#uxnight @mdo: I get 60 notifications a day on github just from bootstrap so I have had to build up a team to handle it
#uxnight @mdo: with 5 million sites out there we feel responsible for a lot of other people
#uxnight @smiley: 5 years ago if you'd said 'are you going to make a thing that 100s of thousands of people use" we'd have said No Way
#uxnight @mdo: if I have misread your issue and closed it without talking to you, let me know
#uxnight @andigalpern: we all want to make the next big thing, but we can get stuck updating
#uxnight @mdo: whatever you work on, you can't fix everyone's issues it's hard
#uxnight @mdo: 5 people on bootstrap full time
#uxnight @smiley: there are about 5 engineers and 4 designers on foundation each day 
#uxnight @mdo: github has an environment where you can work at any time 
#uxnight @andigalpern: if you haven't seen @mdo's coding style guide you should it's on his github
#uxnight @andigalpern: what is the difference in naming convention? @mdo: it was my choice @smiley: and mine
#uxnight @smiley: with foundation we wanted people to come up to speed quickly, so it is very human readable
#uxnight @mdo: there are examples of people building for both bootstrap and foundation
#uxnight @smiley: we do have a lot of similar things between bootstrap and foundation, as there are only so many kinds of things
#uxnight @smiley: both our frameworks and others are reasonably opinionated, find one that fits you
#uxnight @smiley: we always wanted foundation to be as easy to modify as possible - it used to be ugly out of the box
#uxnight @mdo: the biggest one is SASS vs LESS, though Bootstrap 3.1 has a SASS port. 
#uxnight @mdo: in bootstrap we wrote our own CSS linter for LESS which makes it a very legible, and not too nested
#uxnight @mdo: make sure design talks to engineering. We're all smart, intelligent good-looking people trying to do cool things on the net
#uxnight @smiley: if something doesn't work, what are you going to do? Zurb can support foundation
#uxnight @smiley: this is assuming your deign team does anything with code and cares - they should!
#uxnight @smiley: neither of us would have dreamed of this. Its flattering. Not humbling because we have enormous egos
