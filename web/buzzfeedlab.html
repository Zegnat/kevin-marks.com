<p><div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://velociraptor.info'>amandabee</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I'm the senior fellow at Buzzfeed <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/OpenLab">@OpenLab</a>, and welcome to California College of the Arts
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://burtherman.com'>Burt Herman</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>We have more Hacks/Hackers connect coming up in Miami and Brussels
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@christinesunu'>Christine Sunu</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>Here's a stuffed animal, pass it around, don't lose it
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@AAAinsley'>Ainsley Sutherland</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I'm working on a project called Glance that is about desiging responsive environments in VR
<p>Before the Oculus Rift was the Stereograph, invented in the 1800s - the Stereograph as educator
<p>there is a popular narrative that movies displaced 3d images, but there is a parallel narrative where it survived
<p>There were also cycloramas that toured as art works
<p>but the panopticon is another model of spatial surveillance
<p>what is key that you are looking at the system and the system is looking at you
<p>even with a 3d panoramic video, the system is tracking your head movements and knows where you are looking
<p>we had a 360 interview with satya nadella, so I tried replacing the space they were within
<p>this is a demo where you navigate through a series of clips by tapping the space bar while watching
<p>an extension of this would let me annotate and markup the video for collboration
<p>I have a language learning demo where you hear a  conversation then play both parts
<p>there is a yellow cube that if it is in the frustrum, it will switch to the next clip
<p>instead of using raycasting, using frustrum presence makes it easier to interact
<p>part of this technique makes cutting more coherent as you can hold the cut until they're viewing the right spot

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.benkreimer.com'>Ben Kreimer</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I have been using drones to 3d reconstruct archeaological sites that you can navigate
<p>as well as viewing in the browser, we can make a 1st person view in Unity in a game environment
<p>we also have 360 video with low cost drones and cameras - I used 2 gopros with aftermarket lenses
<p>the Ricoh theta S is a lot cheaper, but you lose a lot of resolution; Jaunt uses specialised rigs
<p>The Valley Fire Project used the dual gopro rig to cover the fire, and got t6 million views
<p>the gopros are genlocked, and are automatically synced, so are easy to use 
<p>we ahve a field kit available for buzzfeed reporters to use for this
<p>we also have a drone that can capture 360 video with no camera in the shot

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://westleyargentum.com'>Westley</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I'm working on using games in journalism for things that are hard to describe in words
<p>I have a fantasy football game based on influencing congress though money
<p>you build a team based in special interests that do well in a particular congress, and if bills get support
<p>I use data from Maplight at Berkeley to model different interest groups
<p>framing it as a game helps people concentrate on the details of legislation
<p>we have a game called <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/shit_vcs_say">@shit_vcs_say</a> on an iphone now that challenges you to guess who said what
<p>in the game, if you choose elmo it points out the bad premises of the tweets
<p>we are arguably holding the VCs accountable for the strange things they say
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://saitogroup.info'>Saito</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>The Saito Group suppsrts the cybernetic persona of Saito that broadcasts testimony to the city
<p>right now we are investigating the economic power of the tech industry and how it is reshaping market street
<p>we are creating a projected and geolocated form in the street that people interact with
<p>we have software that lets you search for geolocated tweets for an area and help visualise it
<p>we set up  on the street and remix tweets into poems that show the inequality in the street
<p>you have to deaden yourself when walking to work along market street, but this reopens the conversation
<p>we have a process of writing facilitated by machines, but now they suggest poetic gestures to our writers
<p>we create a display on the street to change a conversation
<p>the installation is along market street at different times , I set up in different places on different nights

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@christinesunu'>Christine Sunu</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I work on emotional storytelling with internet connected hardware, though I have a background in medicine
<p>I am the GE IoT fellow at buzzfeed, so I work on the Internet of Things, but not appliances and vehicles
<p>I am interested in connecting things to the internet that evoke emotions
<p>things made of fabric and stuffing, or metal and stone still affect our emotions
<p>what if we start with objects that already evoke emotions and augment them with technology
<p>I have a series of stuffed animals called Buddy. this one has conductive yarn you can see when he is squeezed
<p>I held buddy while I watched a scary movie, Perfume, and saw spikes where it was scary
<p>given these inputs, how can we help people tell their emotional stories better?
<p>what you can do is look at other sensors as well as the feedback one and see how you react to things
<p>I would like to work with autistic children, but I would need someone to consult with me on this

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://velociraptor.info'>amandabee</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>we now have a call out for new fellows, deadline may 1st - come see us at <a class="auto-link" href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/openlab">http://www.buzzfeed.com/openlab</a>
<p>some fellows are working very closely with reporters, some are more disconnected - we're constantly brainstorming

<p>we want to have this collaboration and create new tools for media that other organisations can use

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@AAAinsley'>Ainsley Sutherland</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>we have worked mostly with video and spatial VR with buzzfeed - the valley fire one is a good example
<p>a lot of video is driven by audio and voiceovers that gives a direction
<p>I want to create space that is malleable and changes as you act
