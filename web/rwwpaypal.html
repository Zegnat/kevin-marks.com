<p><a class='h-card' href='http://readwrite.com/'>Owen Thomas</a>:  <blockquote><p>here tonight we have @davidmarcus President of Paypa [Using the futureofmoney hashtag as rww didn't define one]
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://paypal.com'>David Marcus</a>:  <blockquote><p>Zong got acquired by Paypal in summer 2011 - we built a small merchant swipe system for Paypal.
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://readwrite.com/'>Owen Thomas</a>:  <blockquote><p>the common scenario is "big company buys small company, then the entrepreneur leaves. What's differnt for you?"
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://paypal.com'>David Marcus</a>:  <blockquote><p>The difference is that scaling a payments company is hard. It's not like consumer internet. 
<p>we need to be legally compliant in hundreds of countries, we need to scale, we need fraud detection
<p>I saw a lot of upside opportunity in the Paypal I took over and you can see it growing now
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://readwrite.com/'>Owen Thomas</a>:  <blockquote><p>I see a wasteland of online payment startups that none of us remember. What %age is on ebay.com?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://paypal.com'>David Marcus</a>:  <blockquote><p>ebay is about 30% of paypal. For pure pay startups to succeed, you need a parasite/host relationship
<p>if you think about people on ebay mailing checks to each other across the country, that seems crazy now
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://readwrite.com/'>Owen Thomas</a>:  <blockquote><p>we see that replicated - Google is most successful in payments in the Google Play Store
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://paypal.com'>David Marcus</a>:  <blockquote><p>it's significantly harder to do payments in an environment that you don't control: to do refunds at 140M payers
<p>the compliance burden is not going to get any lighter at any point in the future. Banks have 5000 people on it
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://readwrite.com/'>Owen Thomas</a>:  <blockquote><p>there's Square that a lot of people talk about, braintree that was less talked about but you bought them
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://paypal.com'>David Marcus</a>:  <blockquote><p>Square exists because we fell asleep at the wheel for a few years. They exist because we sucked for a while
<p>Now we're committed to being best in class for developers - thats why we bought Braintree.
<p>Braintree jumped on the mobile bandwagon very early on. We want to lead on mobile
<p>there are more startups that can be built now that everyone has broadband mobile devices with them
<p>I needed to know I'd have enough leeway at paypal to drive the change I wanted to. I got that.
<p>We had 9 different product groups; we were an IT shop with no craftmanship. We now have 1 agile product group
<p>we now have small groups of engineers, product people and designers working on projects. No more waterfall
<p>our old process meant that PM's never got to iterate, as engineers were reassigned after launch
<p>The reason startups can disrupt large companies is because they can iterate faster. We need to iterate at scale
<p>our existing checkout experience that most people see is still pretty outdated.
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://readwrite.com/'>Owen Thomas</a>:  <blockquote><p>I always feel that Paypal is trying to trick me @davidmarcus: that's over.
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://paypal.com'>David Marcus</a>:  <blockquote><p>In the past we used to annoy our best customers by making them connect their bank accounts
<p>you cannot win for along period of time by making your customers do things against their will. We stopped 
<p>if you don't want to add your bank account, you don't have to. It costs more, but you can choose.
<p>We will offer a line of credit, but we won't force it on consumers like we did
<p>2 months ago we started doing small biz lending. Small biz are great people. It's really hard to run a store
<p>one thing small biz needs is working capital. It's very hard for them to get loans from traditional banks
<p>we know the small biz, we see their transactions, we know that they can afford to borrow
<p>We had a wedding dress company - they had a small biz loan, and their brides could borrow to buy dresses
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://readwrite.com/'>Owen Thomas</a>:  <blockquote><p>How do you define mobile payments? taking an Uber? it could be swiping a card on a phone
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://paypal.com'>David Marcus</a>:  <blockquote><p>eventually mobile will be everything, and at that point it will become really easily
<p>eventually you'll authenticate high value transactions on your mobile even if you're using your computer
<p>now we have 2 categories of payments: buying things online using mobile; in-store mobile trnasactions.
<p>last year I said that within 5 years you wouldn't have to carry your wallet in a dense urban area. 4 years now
<p>We have earnings tomorrow, so I can't share numbers, but 2013 was spectacular on mobile
<p>we made some great acquisitions last year. It's like inoculating a large company with a virus to make it safer
<p>If Target had taken paypal, those customers would not have had data compromised
<p>we have 140 million customers who trust us with their financial data. Biometrics need even more trust
<p>Target being hacked will lead to Chip and Pin in the US faster. a worse consumer experience, but more secure
<p>we're working with VISA and MC to pass hashes instead of in the clear numbers so customers protected

<a class='h-card' href='http://readwrite.com/'>Owen Thomas</a>:  <blockquote><p>What happened with Uber today? How do you respond on twitter like that
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://paypal.com'>David Marcus</a>:  <blockquote><p>it doesn't take that much time to respond on twitter - you can do it 15-20 mins a day, when team can resolve
<p>any corporate CEO who says they don't have time for twitter customers is bullshitting - control your own time
<p>we need to be fanatical about making our customers love us. Money is emotional, we need the right emotion
<p>I don't know what happened with Uber today, but we will protect our customers 100% of the time. We'll fix it.
<p>Bitcoin is a ledger - it's a store of value. That can be interesting if you're somewhere like venezuala
<p>Bitcoin may become a currency in future, but it's not there due to volatility
<p>all the payment processors now don't settle in Bitcoin, they do it in fiat currency - it
<p>Paypal is like TCP/IP I encourage you to read @pmarca's NYT piece today: http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/21/why-bitcoin-matters/
<p>governments have very different attitudes to bitcoin. China banned it, Norway taxes capital gains. 
<p>Bitcoin will shake out legally this year. We're paying attention.
<p>There's no buyer protection with Bitcoin. Paypal offers that

<a class='h-card' href=''></a>:  <blockquote><p>we sell electricity in developing markets. How do you move money without broadband?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://paypal.com'>David Marcus</a>:  <blockquote><p>we've done this in Brazil, data plans are 10%, smartphones 30% on wifi. We built a flow on *21# - 2M customers
<p>the hard part of being a global company is adapting to these local conditions
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://readwrite.com/'>Owen Thomas</a>:  <blockquote><p>How do you compete with SF based startups for talent?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://paypal.com'>David Marcus</a>:  <blockquote><p>We have a lot of people who commute, which is a pain in the neck, because the opportunity is there
<p>we need ot find a way for people in the city to work too. Nothing to announce today
<p>Cash was money 1.0 - plastic is money 2.0; consumer credit and all these great things this country was built on
<p>Mobile is Money 3.0. I think all of this will be mobile in time, but cash is very hard to get rid of.
<p>I went door to door with small businesses - they say they still want their old cash register. 
<p>Businesses don't want to declare every transaction for tax, or pay fees for each small one.
<p>our relationship with banks is the best its been in years - we are very complementary
<p>our lending is single digit billions of dollars, whereas banks have 100s of billions of lending
<p>we have data the banks don't have. That means we can make underwriting decisions that they can't
<p>[asked about insureance] Focus is important. There is a curse in large biz of doing too much
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://readwrite.com/'>Owen Thomas</a>:  <blockquote><p>Paypal used to sell mutual funds - they sued to overreach
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://paypal.com'>David Marcus</a>:  <blockquote><p>We've killed so many things. You have no idea. We're going to deprecate a lot of products this year
<p>[asked about M-PESA] we have partnerships with carriers when we can, but they need to make it easier
