#iiw @IdentityWoman: lets see if we can introduce ourselves with one word this time
#iiw @benwerd: I'm one of the indie posse here today - I'm doing an Introduction to the #indieweb
#iiw @aaronpk: I'm doing a session on indieauth, making your own site an identity provider #indieweb
#iiw @kevinmarks: I have a practical session "Join the #indieweb" - get your personal indie website set up
#iiw @Johannes_Ernst: indiebox is a home server for your family to use that connects to the net
#iiw @Johannes_Ernst: crowd funding for Indie Box has started today: https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/indie-box-let-s-bring-our-data-home #indieweb
#iiw @benwerd is taking great notes at https://etherpad.mozilla.org/iiw on the @indieboxproject 
#iiw @Johannes_Ernst: the internet has become a centralised system. Indiebox is mean to turn that back so you can have your own server
#iiw @aaronpk: philips hue lightbulbs also have a server in your house that you can access without their cloud service
#iiw @Johannes_Ernst: I'd like to run an app against all the devices in my house
#iiw @Johannes_Ernst: we don't have an app that is an IDP app @aaronpk: hey, I have one @johannes_ernst: great lets use it
#iiw @benwerd: we talk a lot in #indieweb about "silos" - dropbox, facebook etc who make money by locking up our data
#iiw @benwerd: facebook is a fantastic proof of concept of a social network, but they take control away from you
#iiw @benwerd: #indieweb is about having your own space on the web - your own domain as your primary identity
#iiw @benwerd: the #indieweb goal is for you not to lose anything by not being in the silos, by connecting to them
#iiw @benwerd: I haven't posted directly to facebook or twitter for a year, I post to my site and share to them instead
#iiw @benwerd: the #indieweb community practices what we preach - we build for our own sites not making standards for other people
#iiw @benwerd: there are lots of small building blocks that we use to build the #indieweb - microformats are how we add meaning to web pages
#iiw @benwerd: another building block is webmentions http://indiewebcamp.com/webmention that tell sites when you have linked to them
#iiw @benwerd: by using these buliding blocks we can have likes, retweets, replies, and RSVPs on our own #indieweb sites
#iiw @benwerd: currently this is mostly about publicly visible data, but we add authentication with indieauth.com
#iiw @benwerd: we are not trying to establish a huge standards organisation, but instead a community of people who implement and discuss
#iiw @benwerd: how many people have their own websites? [most] how many post regularly [fewer]
#iiw @smagdali: does posting once a year count as regularly?
#iiw @aaronpk: twitter can be almost to easy - you need an interface that is as easy to us as twitter for your own site
#iiw @aaronpk: there is an opportunity for "twitter apps" for your own site - use other people's apps to post to your own #indieweb site
#iiw @kevinmarks: shows off noterlive, which is  a way to post these kind of live tweets and keep them for posting on my own site
#iiw @benwerd: @aaronpk has posted a photo on his site - I can reply to that using idno's firefox plugin and it shows on my site
#iiw @benwerd: I can also reply to @kevinmarks's tweet using the Firefox plugin, and it posts on my site and shares it to twitter too 
#iiw @benwerd: There's an event tomorrow night in SF called Homebrew Website Club - I can RSVP to that on my site + share to Facebook
#iiw @benwerd: creating the twitter and facebook integrations for idno too about an hour and a half each
#iiw @benwerd: I'd love to create a way to upload HTML5 games and post them to your site and send highscores by webmentions
#iiw @benwerd: it's an open community - there's an IRC channel: http://indiewebcamp.com/IRC and a wikihttp://indiewebcamp.com - all are welcome
#iiw @benwerd: it's an open community - there's an IRC channel: http://indiewebcamp.com/IRC and a wiki http://indiewebcamp.com - all are welcome
#iiw @benwerd: other sites could ahut down apis, but at least you don't lose your own posts when that happens
#iiw @benwerd: with silo'd sites there is na ethnocentric design as they're all made here in SF - indieweb is less SV dominated
#iiw @smagdali: this is interesting from a hacker perspective, but how big can it go? this blogging will never catch on 
#iiw @aaronpk: there is a page on the wiki for wider adoption: http://indiewebcamp.com/generations (there's a page for everything)
#iiw @benwerd: we're more likely to get to mainstream by iterating on working code and consensus
#iiw @smagdali: I've run lots of my servers at home (and fax machines) -what happens when they're all botnets?
#iiw @kevinmarks: not necessarily hoem servers, can be in cloud, or even static sites that can be synced
#iiw @aaronpk: there are ways that we can do this with a wholly static site and services that build the communication parts
#iiw @sbw: the other way is to run an unhosted app that posts to a static server and have the data locally in the browser
#iiw @benwerd: one advantage of making this web-centric is that we don't have to impose any architecture on anyone else to communicate
#iiw @benwerd: how to get started? one list is at indiewebify.me
#iiw @aaronpk: first get your own domain and put up a page that links to your existing profiles elsewhere, so you have your own space
#iiw @t: also look at http://indiewebcamp.com/Getting_Started to see where to go
#iiw @erinjo: we're hoping by the end of the summer to have idno be a one-click install http://idno.co/
#iiw @erinjo: the idno code is all on github at https://github.com/idno/idno tomorrow it will be called "known"
#iiw @benwerd: we're going to switch to MySQL from mongo on idno to make it run where wordpress runs
#iiw @benwerd: we're not quite there yet to be able to deploy a dynamic site anywhere
#iiw @benwerd: do come to Homebrew Website Club meetings on wednesdays in SF, Portland, Chichago + sunnyvale http://indiewebcamp.com/events/2014-05-07-homebrew-website-club
#iiw @sbw: is indieauth what I used to log into the wiki? @aaronpk: yes @sbw: I have a bug report
#iiw @aaronpk: if you have signed into indiewebcamp.com you have used indieauth already
#iiw @aaronpk: If you link from your site to and form a silo with rel="me" that is relMeAuth -you delegate authentication to a silo
#iiw @aaronpk: this lets you use your own domain as the identifier, but other sites as authentication
#iiw @aaronpk: indieauth.com is a little confusing as it is doing two things
#iiw @aaronpk: indieauth.com came from wanting to add relMeAuth to mediawiki on indiewebcamp.com
#iiw @aaronpk: instead of getting down in mediawiki code to add auth, I made indieauth.com do to auth as service
#iiw @aaronpk: by making indieauth.com a service, I could add a small plugin to mediawiki to talk to indieauth
#iiw @aaronpk: I initially didn't expect anyone else to use indieauth.com originally
#iiw @aaronpk: one of the things that OAuth2 did different from OAuth1 was separating auth as an internal service
#iiw @aaronpk: after I made it work with the wiki, I made it work with my own site hosting p3k
#iiw @aaronpk: we need to find an OAuth2 provider agreed on between indieauth and the user
#iiw @aaronpk: I had the same problem with posting to my own site - I needed authZ to post to my own site
#iiw @aaronpk: http://ownyourgram.com/ is a way to post to your micropub endpoint when you send photos to instagram
#iiw @aaronpk: as OAuth2 doesn't specify discovery, we have OpenID Connect, and no other spec. 
#iiw @aaronpk: I used rel=authorization-endpoint and rel=token-endpoint from existing specs and made up rel=micropub
#iiw @aaronpk: one of my goals is to avoid crypto and rely on TLS like OAuth2 did (it seemed like a good idea at the time)
#iiw @kevinmarks: well, the SSL code has had a lot of people look at it closely recently
#iiw @zer0n1ne: @aaronpk should look up token introspection as an OAuth spec (which I wrote) - similar to IndieAuth token factoring
#iiw @aaronpk: indieuath can be an internal part of the wiki, or it can be service that the user's micropub site uses
#iiw @zer0n1ne: UMA is a protocol built on OAuth2 and OpenID connect to introduce the client to the auth services
#iiw @zer0n1ne: there's a lot of potential synergy between UMA and what the Indieauth delegation is trying to do
#iiw @zer0n1ne: there is a profile of OpenID Connect that lets you defer verifying the signature, but implementations do it anyway
#iiw @zer0n1ne: what if you don't have an HTML parser?
#iiw @kevinmarks: we have an HTML parser service in the cloud that will make it into JSON for you #indieweb
