#socosy2016 @pomeranian99: if I were to give a talk it would be on a data analysis that found the creepiest word in Macbeth
#socosy2016 @brady: we're going to be talking about the future of entertainment this morning
#socosy2016 @nadsman: internetainment is bridging the gap between digital an television - digital you can make about 1/10 of what TV pays
#socosy2016 @nadsman: our show @midnight has a game we play called #hashtagwars which has kept us on the air 
#socosy2016 @nadsman: you want the biggest stage possible - sometimes that is digital, but if media matters at all TV is what they want
#socosy2016 @nadsman: in 2013 we created an app called Briandex that was an interactive show - a 10 question trivia show; 500k downloads
#socosy2016 @nadsman: there is power in the long tail, but there is power in the expensive creator space too - there is a disconnect
#socosy2016 @nadsman: youtube has the long tail; they're trying to work out how to remunerate the middle tail and compete with netflix
#socosy2016 @nadsman: as an advocate for the creator. the business model for tv is fantastic when it works; for digital it is not clear
#socosy2016 @BobMankoff: the internet is hard to monetize, but maybe it is s different creative world - most don't make money in any case
#socosy2016 @BobMankoff: instead of everyone being a spectator, we have a world of creativity that in and of itself is valuable
#socosy2016 @nadsman: when snapchat tells me half a million people watched this snap I don't necessarily believe it
#socosy2016 @gavinpurcell: we get very different reactions to tonight show clips from people on facebook, youtube and twitter
#socosy2016 @gavinpurcell: the late night TV shows are essentially a content factory - we can always have stuff to put out on the net
#socosy2016 @BobMankoff: humour is essentially social, and so there is an ideal environment for it in these social networks
#socosy2016 @gavinpurcell: humor is exploding, criticism and anger shows are exploding because people want to feel something
#socosy2016 @melissaeccles: we make emotionally connected creative experiences, from mind controlled bikes to space shuttles through LA
#socosy2016 @melissaeccles: my job is to help people avoid reality as long as possible
#socosy2016 @melissaeccles: what we did for game of thrones was create a fan experience for them to see the future - greensight
#socosy2016 @melissaeccles: how do you quantify enchantment? - we looked at the psychographics of interaction
#socosy2016 @melissaeccles: fan service is not just merketing - it is creating things that give value to the fans over time
#socosy2016 @melissaeccles: when you connect to the fan groups, they will spread it to the less engaged people marketing is going for
#socosy2016 @melissaeccles: VR is great for creating immersion, but not at creating a way for you to react and act on it
#socosy2016 @melissaeccles: it doesn't matter which medium you start with, what matters is your story
#socosy2016 @raegarcia: there are 400 TV shows competing for audiences, but they are also competing with everythgin that has ever been made
#socosy2016 @raegarcia: people barely differentiate the entertainment from their facebook pages than from their TV shows
#socosy2016 @raegarcia: our channel is still a primary destination that we want people to go to, but we embrace the digital shift
#socosy2016 @raegarcia: with Doctor Who we had the challenge of building a cult phenomenon into mainstream hit
#socosy2016 @raegarcia: with Doctor Who we stopped thinking about seasons and made it a year-round stategy
#socosy2016 @raegarcia: we've gone from curating and celebrating fan activity to writing it into the show
#socosy2016 @raegarcia: they have written cosplaying into the show, so now we have cosplayers playing cosplayers
#socosy2016 @raegarcia: in a multi-channel univers, FOMO is the programmer's best friend 
#socosy2016 @raegarcia: Doctor Who is a kids show in the UK
#socosy2016 @tomcoates: I've only watched every episode of Doctor Who since 1980, so I can't comment on all of it
#socosy2016 @tomcoates: Doctor Who is not a kids show, it's a family show, and you have to know1 episode in 3 will be terrible
#socosy2016 @tomcoates: is there a danger in making it too insular if it is about too much fan service
#socosy2016 @nadsman: you're the american licensor of doctor who - do you get dissonance with the UK people?
#socosy2016 @raegarcia: we work very closely with the UK now and are in constant communication with territorial 
#socosy2016 @mtyka: Paul Delaroche in 1839 declared painting dead because of photography - this didn't happen
#socosy2016 @mtyka: Turing write a paper on organising unorganised machinery - but this was ignored until the last few years
#socosy2016 @mtyka: neural networks work by having successive layers of artificial neurons connected with weights, you adjust the weights
#socosy2016 @mtyka: depending what layer you amplify, you see different structures from the training
#socosy2016 @mtyka: this neuron has turtle-ness - there is no actual turtle in it
#socosy2016 @mtyka: we need not to over-anthropomorphise the deep dream images
#socosy2016 @mtyka: I think these are going to be good tools for creators by inspiring them with things to rebuild
#socosy2016 @BobMankoff: I think there is something essential that we do because we are not algorithms
#socosy2016 @mtyka: these images have a tendency to become very boring very quickly - we're not interested in what the machine thought
#socosy2016 @neuraltheory: whether a neural network is biased or not depends on how it was raised
#socosy2016 @AliceMarwick: the deep dream images tend to creep people out, but the music doesn't - why is that?
#socosy2016 @mtyka: a lot of that is because the network was trained on animals so combining animals and people is always creepy
#socosy2016 @femfreq: These harassment mobs are not unique to me 
#socosy2016 @femfreq: I get hate speech, dox attacks, ddos of my site, campaigns to report me to the fbi
#socosy2016 @femfreq: The Wikipedia entry has been replaced with porn images, and endless requests to include conspiracy theories 
#socosy2016 @femfreq: When I posted a video to YouTube they campaigned to mass report me to YouTube 
#socosy2016 @femfreq: I was able to get YouTube to put my work back up, but other women targeted  may not have that reach 
#socosy2016 @femfreq: Perpetrators treat this as a game - they refer to us a bosses, and document attacks to show off to one another 
#socosy2016 @femfreq: Women who are harassed are told to toughen up and grow a thick skin, and that my threats are fake 
#socosy2016 @femfreq: We see a an aggressive denial of women's experiences -  we are told that we are making it up
#socosy2016 @femfreq: We need to fundamentally change the online networks structure to reduce these attacks 
#socosy2016 @femfreq: The other area of focus is the legal system - women who report abuse to police have their info given out to harassers 
#socosy2016 @femfreq: A colleague called the police to report a death threat, was treated as hysterical. They asked to speak to her husband 
#socosy2016 @femfreq: You can't be neutral on a moving train. We all need to be involved with fixing rhis
#socosy2016 @cypheroftyr: I started the hashtag #ineeddiversegames when I was frustrated in the middle of the night 
#socosy2016 @cypheroftyr: If you don't get to see yourself in games, you miss out. 
#socosy2016 @cypheroftyr: Most video game protagonists are 30 year old brown eyed white males 
#socosy2016 @cypheroftyr: I love Witcher 3, but when I complained about diversity I was told it was Polish myth, despite it having dwarves 
#socosy2016 @cypheroftyr: The game Rust randomised your race and gender, and white gamers freaked out at having to play black characters 
#socosy2016 @cypheroftyr: I get to block over 100000 accounts on twitter because I asked for diversity. I have to use 3 blocking toools
#socosy2016 @cypheroftyr: I worry now about boosting someone else's project in case it brings harassment to their door
#socosy2016 @cypheroftyr: Online and real life are the same. Kill the phrase irl. 
#socosy2016 @oliverhaimson: I study transgender  experience with online harassment 
#socosy2016 @oliverhaimson: Navigating gender transition online can be as hard as in the physical world 
#socosy2016 @oliverhaimson: We often talk about online as  safe space for gender experimentation, but we see a lot of harassment for ir
#socosy2016 @oliverhaimson: Especially in a "real name"  environment like Facebook trans people get attacked 
#socosy2016 @oliverhaimson: "I experience sexism as a woman more than transphobic discrimination" 
#socosy2016 @oliverhaimson: Facebook uses the terminology "authentic names" in opposition to "fake" -  this gives people ability to harass 
#socosy2016 @oliverhaimson: Facebook disallowing multiple accounts makes  it difficult to transition online 
#socosy2016 @xeeliz: One of the things that keeps coming up is that people are silenced. Many people we asked to speak refused for fear
#socosy2016 @farrah_khan: Abused people are told to shut down their social media accounts, even though this is where they tell friends 
#socosy2016 @farrah_khan: Online sexual violence and threats are not "stranger danger" a lot use surveillance tactics 
#socosy2016 @farrah_khan: Violent partners will often break into your accounts to monitor you  and intimidate
#socosy2016 @farrah_khan: We have a death review committee in Ontario, we find attempts to isolate and threaten women 
#socosy2016 @farrah_khan: Survivors are also using social media to discuss their abuse
#socosy2016 @femfreq: Women attacked by gamergate most were ones who challenged the status quo, sometimes just by revealing gender 
#socosy2016 @cypheroftyr: When I show up in gaming as a black woman in my 40s I get challenged for being there
#socosy2016 @femfreq: technical solutions don't work alone, we need cultural change too, and that can be harder
#socosy2016 @refikanadol: I was 9 years old when I saw Blade Runner, and  maybe that is why I moved to Los Angeles -it's now 3 years off
#socosy2016 @refikanadol: what if light as a materiel by projecting on architecture
#socosy2016 @refikanadol: I put together data landscapes and sculptures in san francisco http://www.refikanadol.com/works/virtual-depictions-san-francisco/
