<p>brid.gy accepts those webmentions, adn if you say in reply to a tweet, brid.gy sees that and posts it as a tweet

<a class='h-card' href='https://snarfed.org/'>Ryan Barrett</a>:  <blockquote><p>brid.gy transaltes from theis common protocol to each of the silos own APIs - you need to know to send webmentions

<a class='h-card' href='https://snarfed.org/'>Ryan Barrett</a>:  <blockquote><p>silos fight spam hard, so they are likely to be less spammy
<p>spam filtering and fighting is part of any communication system you'll run something that helps this
<p>right now there is no way to POSSE to instagram - so we use a trick to add a link to your site from IG
<p>securing login is fundamentally hard - the great idea of IndieAuth is to use the big companies' hard work for that

<p>the big thing that facebook has is they are the one place where everyone is. What do they do when they aren't?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://snarfed.org/'>Ryan Barrett</a>:  <blockquote><p>one of the things I can do easily with twitter or facebook is fave, share, comment - we need to make indie as easy
