<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.jenson.org'>Scott Jenson</a>:  <blockquote><p>I have achieved a lot this weekend - I have cleaned up <a class="auto-link" href="http://www.jenson.org">http://www.jenson.org</a> in wordpress and got indie stuff working
<p>I redesigned 'what is the indieweb' with: your content is safe; you are better connected; you are in control

<a class='h-card' href='https://snarfed.org/'>Ryan Barrett</a>:  <blockquote><p>we've been talking about people focused communication - so instead of having apps you have website with contacts
<p>we are all going to choose different formatting for the 'contact me these ways' but I want consistent design
<p>I have a browser user script and user style that gives the same icons everywhere on everyone's sites
<p>most of you know <a class="auto-link" href="http://brid.gy">brid.gy</a> - it pulls comments and likes back to your site - I want to do the other direction too
<p>so at <a class="auto-link" href="http://brid.gy/publish">brid.gy/publish</a> I have a webmention handler it will figure out your post and POSSE into silos
<p>I am making a like on my site that points to a a tweet and add a link to <a class="auto-link" href="http://brid.gy/publish/twitter">brid.gy/publish/twitter</a>
<p>similarly I can publish an RSVP link back to Facebook
<p>so I favorited this tweet and RSVP
<p>and I RSVP'd to this facebook event via posting on my own site
<p>if you send a webmention for this post URL you will cause a favorite on twitter or like/RSVP on FB
<p>this is alpha, I have no docs yet. try it on <a class="auto-link" href="http://brid.gy/publish">brid.gy/publish</a>

<a class='h-card' href='http://wavis.org/'>wavis</a>:  <blockquote><p>I want to demo addressibility - this is an http server in 14 lines
<p>by addressing the SHA384 sum off the file I get the file itself back
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://markmhendrickson.com'>Mark Hendrickson</a>:  <blockquote><p>I have a project <a class="auto-link" href="http://asheville.io">asheville.io</a> that backs up your posts from silos like twitter and fb, and foursquare
<p>first asheville syncs your content on a server like dropbox, google drive, then makes an API for it for you
<p>I'm using the APIs that they provide to download your content onto your dropbox
<p>you can create a centralising machine to get your content back home <a class="auto-link" href="http://indiewebcamp.com/PESOS">http://indiewebcamp.com/PESOS</a>
<p>I want to make my website powered by asheville to show all my stuff
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.jenson.org'>Scott Jenson</a>:  <blockquote><p>mobiles aren't always ready, so occasionally I'll post to twitter in a moment of weakness, so asheville will tidy up
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://caseorganic.com/'>Amber Case</a>:  <blockquote><p>I had a really fun time making comics about the indieweb
<p>the first session we had was about different indieweb generations - people complaining about wht went wrong
<p>how I made a comic in a few hours - I used <a class="auto-link" href="http://toonlet.com/comic">toonlet.com/comic</a> which has character libraries to use
<p>then I imported the characters into omnigraffle and imported some comic bubbles
<p>also I made a new wiki page called Barriers to categorise people and their approch to the indieweb <a class="auto-link" href="http://indiewebcamp.com/barriers">http://indiewebcamp.com/barriers</a>
<p>I think of it as 4 generations - from coder to end-user and map through the stages for each
<p>generation 1 is the developers like us who make custom blogging systems and can spawn code
<p>generation 2 is people like <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/dangillmor">@dangillmor</a> and <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/scottros">@scottros</a> who own their domains and post, now they get the conversation
<p>Generation 3 have a domain and 3rd party hosting - setting up a name server
<p>Generation 4 have never bought a domain, and only used 3rd party software. you're slinging zipfiles at their brain
<p>we need each of these generations to explain to the next one down - we want an incremental approach

<a class='h-card' href='http://dunlaps.net/darius'>Darius C. Dunlap</a>:  <blockquote><p>I'm thinking about what it would be like to do a full posse for the non-profit my wife runs, as she does it by hand
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.jenson.org'>Scott Jenson</a>:  <blockquote><p>I set up POSSE, but ti was on a hair-trigger - every edit sent a new update
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>we should look at things that are successful - how do you make buying and using a domain as easy as a cellphone?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://kevinmarks.com'>Kevin Marks</a>:  <blockquote><p>that <a class="auto-link" href="http://squarespace.com">squarespace.com</a> put a superbowl ad up to buy a domain and configure is a marker for this - reach out 
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://dunlaps.net/darius'>Darius C. Dunlap</a>:  <blockquote><p>squarespace have a dev api - not sure what it is
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://aaronparecki.com'>Aaron Parecki</a>:  <blockquote><p> I now have a live demo of <a class="auto-link" href="http://ownyourgram.com">ownyourgram.com</a> - it does one test photo
<p>first you authorize your own domain with indieauth and micropub, then you auth in with instagram, and it gets 1 photo
<p>at this point you need to handle posting a photo to your site
<p>and it made this post: <a class="auto-link" href="http://aaronparecki.com/notes/2014/03/08/4/indiewebcamp-indieweb-sf">http://aaronparecki.com/notes/2014/03/08/4/indiewebcamp-indieweb-sf</a> of this photo <a class="auto-link figure" href="http://aaronparecki.com/notes/2014/03/08/4/files/photo.jpg"><img src="http://aaronparecki.com/notes/2014/03/08/4/files/photo.jpg"/></a>
<p>once I get this working I can make any photo I post on Instagram come back to my site
<p>I'm waiting for instagram to whitelist me to post comments to make this work fully

<a class='h-card' href='http://kylewm.com'>Kyle Mahan</a>:  <blockquote><p>I'm new to this - I came to the wiki and then tried to implement it from scratch from the wiki
<p>i was working with brid,gy, trying to get things done within each 10 minute update cycle
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://snarfed.org/'>Ryan Barrett</a>:  <blockquote><p><a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/kyle_wm">@kyle_wm</a> is the first <a class="auto-link" href="http://brid.gy">brid.gy</a> contributor other than me -he added support for Show Original on facebook

<a class='h-card' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>I started out with this blogpost <a class="auto-link" href="http://tantek.com/2013/338/b1/people-focused-mobile-communication-experience">http://tantek.com/2013/338/b1/people-focused-mobile-communication-experience</a> I have a habit of writing before building - must be w3c habits
<p>I then made anew blogpost documenting my idea <a class="auto-link" href="http://tantek.com/2014/067/b1/building-blocks-people-focused-mobile-communication">http://tantek.com/2014/067/b1/building-blocks-people-focused-mobile-communication</a> then mockups to tell a story <a class="auto-link" href="http://tantek.com/2014/067/b1/building-blocks-people-focused-mobile-communication">http://tantek.com/2014/067/b1/building-blocks-people-focused-mobile-communication</a> 
<p>a lor of this work was already on the wiki, so I made a narrative flow to help explain it
<p>we do work on our own sites, but narrating it for other people too is also useful

<a class='h-card' href='http://kevinmarks.com'>Kevin Marks</a>:  <blockquote><p>I tried to use the <a class="auto-link" href="http://activitystrea.ms">activitystrea.ms</a> site today, and it was far to dry to make sense of. this narrative is needed
<p>I have a number showing how many characters are left <a class="auto-link" href="http://noterlive.com">noterlive.com</a>
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>kevin is the first person to run the cassis code in javascript not php

<a class='h-card' href='http://kevinmarks.com'>Kevin Marks</a>:  <blockquote><p>I started making <a class="auto-link" href="http://noterlive.com">noterlive.com</a> work with micropub, but I didn't get it potted from PHP to node yet
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://pauloppenheim.com'>pauloppenheim</a>:  <blockquote><p>I like the indieweb, but I am a curmudgeon who doesn't want to post online. But can I be involved in private messaging
<p>with a static site of my own, I can sign into <a class="auto-link" href="http://aaronparecki.com">aaronparecki.com</a> and see a private message for me
<p>I don't have anything on my site. this is like receiving a dm on twitter without a twitter account at all
<p>I'd like to receive webmentions, but I don't have a thing to receive them
<p>If I curl with a source and a target to me webmention url, it outputs to standard error and I can check notifications
<p>I can parse the error log of my webhost to notify myself 
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>the next indiewebcamp is April 26-27 in NYC, hosted by the New York Times - we need sponsors
