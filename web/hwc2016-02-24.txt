#indieweb @t: welcome to Homebrew Website Club - we just finished Indiewebcamp NYC last weekend- we extended it from friday to sunday
#indieweb @t: David Shansky recorded al the sessions for us - that's GWG on irc
#indieweb @t: we had a number of folks that didn't have a website and were non-technical, all 4 were set up with a domain and site
#indieweb @t: we were told that we used so much jargon that it is like learning a foreign language, so we worked on that
#indieweb @t: @tommorris created a really simple beginning of my webpage on github: https://github.com/indieweb/blank-gh-site that people can fork
#indieweb @t: if you go to emmahodge.org you can see someone who used tom's template to get her own name as a domain
#indieweb @t: sometimes something really small that is less than a page of code can really help someone understand
#indieweb @t: Webmention being published as a w3c draft got a lot of attention on hacker news, which is the usual: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10943261
#indieweb @t: I had a problem with my iPod touch losing wifi, and the only answer was to wipe and reinstall, which would lose my data
#indieweb @t: github has been down all afternoon. Which is ironic as it is 2 days since Google Code shut down- they broke all URLs
#indieweb @t: note that while github.com was down, github.io static sites were still up
#indieweb @t: Indiewebcamp MIT is on Gregorian Pi day - March 13th - so sign up if you are nearby http://indiewebcamp.com/2016/MIT
#indieweb @benwerd: I'm ben though I look like evil tantek tonight - I run withknown.com which is an indieweb startup
#indieweb @benwerd: I'd like to introduce you to Joshua joshua.withknown.com - I built my own Siri
#indieweb @benwerd: this uses a web API for speech to text - it puts it through some stanford NLP technology, and looks for signatures
#indieweb @benwerd: Siri is a black box, Google Now is a black box, wouldn't it be fun if we could plug our own data into them
#indieweb @benwerd: Joshua, is it safe to leave Mozilla? "yes, there isn't a Giants game on"
#indieweb @benwerd: The same engine can be attached to slack or whatever, but this runs in a web browser, it's not in a device
#indieweb @benwerd: if someone wants to write a better joke API for it, please do it
#indieweb @benwerd: the technology exists to parse text from speech  - we need a way to make it ours too
#indieweb @scottros: what happens if you ask "what will the weather be tomorrow?"  
#indieweb @benwerd: it gave me the weather for the server in Dallas - here's it from localhost
#indieweb @kevinmarks: you need to hook Joshua up to @aaronpk's Loqi
#indieweb @benwerd: yes, I really need to do that
#indieweb @benwerd: I could make it post for me and tweet for me - or ask it "where should I be?"
#indieweb @libertymadison: no-one wants to follow that
#indieweb @kylewmahan: wow, it's not much javascript at all
#indieweb @t: I have had hashtags on my site for a while, but they only got linked on the POSSE copies to twitter and facebook
#indieweb @t: so now I markup hashtags with a category automatically on my site so when I POSSE to flickr they go through
#indieweb @t: I have been POSSEing manually to flickr with brid.gy - because I added this, flickr has my tags https://www.flickr.com/photos/tantek/24345146530/in/dateposted/
#indieweb @t: I took a photo at Indiewebcamp NYC - and tagged people. and brid.gy copied across the people who gave permission
#indieweb @scottros: my site is http://www.wordyard.com which is a wordpress site
#indieweb @scottros: So @libertymadison, @kevinmarks and I were at Hacks Hackers Connect #HHConnect this weekend and I started a group
#indieweb @scottros: So I was frustrated with having to cross-post links and posts from my wordpress to lots of other sites, 
#indieweb @scottros: so I proposed a write once, post many places tool - and I understand that withknown.com does a lot of this
#indieweb @scottros: we brainstormed ideas on what would help with the problem of cross-posting longform content
#indieweb @benwerd: so this was Lean Product Canvas?
#indieweb @scottros: I had all sorts of quibbles and arguments with the nomenclature - why would the advantage be unfair?
#indieweb @scottros: so the idea would be to create an ideal post with title, image content etc, and then see previews of it in each silo
#indieweb @scottros: so on twitter, if your summary is over 140 you would truncate it
#indieweb @benwerd: on twitter, you may need to publish it somewhere else first
#indieweb @kevinmarks: the challenge I see is the longer form posts that have substructure
#indieweb @libertymadison: so we liked the idea of being able to make sense of the post and use AI to map it to what the platform wants
#indieweb @scottros: I was trying to keep it minimal, so when I hear AI I am a bit wary
#indieweb @scottros: If we're doing the publish once, syndicate everywhere, I want the post to be in those places honoring their differences
#indieweb @scottros: it's still hard to do that
#indieweb @benwerd: the meme with, say, AMP is that the content comes to you - it gets imported by whichever system
#indieweb @benwerd: you may have designed it for google search results, but @nuzzel sees the same thing
#indieweb @kevinmarks: vine needs 6 seconds, instagram 15 seconds, flickr 120 seconds - video is harder
#indieweb @libertymadison: I have to do this very day when I ma making video
#indieweb @scottros: this was heavily publisher and journalist oriented - a lot of people are doing this within their employers systems
#indieweb @scottros: part of being a journalist now is to crosspost your work to tumblr and twiitter and so on
#indieweb @benwerd: the criticism I have always got is that people need to re-edit for different destinations
#indieweb @benwerd: the trick is thta people
#indieweb @benwerd: people's definition of viable varies - what people expect for audiences is tricky
#indieweb @benwerd: I ma stubborn and I think of overlapping audiences, but each site does have
#indieweb @kevinmarks: my take is that we can add substructure to posts that makes sense elsewhere
#indieweb @benwerd: all the joke APIs on the internet I could find are terrible dad jokes from the 1970s - I need a better one
#indieweb @benwerd: the journey of the entrepreneur is often like Sideshow Bob and the rakes
#indieweb @rrrrrrrix: my domain is whatthefuck.computer which gets me more comment on the domain than the content
#indieweb @rrrrrrrix: it also ends up as my indiewebcamp wiki username, which is a shame
#indieweb @rrrrrrrix: my site is made from a bunch of emacs LISP that makes html pages
#indieweb @rrrrrrrix: I built my own static site engine and started using indieweb stuff to get comments on my blog to automate with brid.gy
#indieweb @rrrrrrrix: I connect the matrix chat system to the indieweb here http://whatthefuck.computer/blog/2015/12/19/matrix-and-indieweb/
#indieweb @rrrrrrrix: matrix at matrix.org is a modern IRC, a json http API, but the rooms don't live in the same place
#indieweb @rrrrrrrix: as long as someone is in the room on matrix it persists
#indieweb @t: the next Homebrew Website Club is February 10th - post your photos on your own site so we can reuse them
#indieweb @t: welcome to homebrew website club - last time I shared the off the record URL for micropub
#indieweb @t: since then the w3c has published the 1st public working draft of Micropub https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/
#indieweb @t: the Micropub spec is the 2nd result on google, which is good when it competes with small public houses https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micropub
#indieweb @t: which is an opportunity for someone to create a disambiguation page on wikipedia, as w3c is notable
#indieweb @t: here is a suitable citation: https://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/5286
#indieweb @t: the indieweb summit dates are set for June 4th and 5th in Portland, OR
#indieweb @t: who has something to share or something that they need help with
#indieweb @benwerd: the open bot Trink I showed last meeting is now a real project for Withknown that we are building
#indieweb @benwerd: the Known open source project is getting lots of pull requests now, and there is a Docker repo
#indieweb @kylewmahan: on my known site I added a notification screen for things that would otherwise go to email from Known
#indieweb @kylewmahan: I was trying out the HTML5 notifications today so it will show me notifications when things come in
#indieweb @t: every browser has set up a behind the scenes push notification server for their browser, which will call your service worker
#indieweb @t: having notifications is interesting anyway - maybe you can hook it up to the SWAT0 flow
#indieweb @t: I got something minor done - automatic POSSE to flickr of Photos and maybe video
#indieweb @t: I built this on brid.gy publish to flickr, which means I am publishing syndication URLs to flickr too
#indieweb @t: we are now 100% on our January commitments as @aaronpk shipped his site https://indiewebcamp.com/2016-01-01-commitments
#indieweb @t: we also have a new Indiewebcamp logo design from Shaners https://slack-files.com/T03QR2B2T-F0LFT9G3T-fe40b97474 http://indiewebcamp.com/logo
#indieweb @rrrrrrrix: I built a webring - because I use it as an interview question
#indieweb @rrrrrrrix: so I have a DHT based webring in javascript for matrix
#indieweb @benwerd: I like the idea of a webring, and of a public timeline - as it shows 'here are the people"
#indieweb @rrrrrrrix: instructions for adding your site to the distributed webring is at http://ring.whatthefuck.computer
#indieweb @t: this is the Homebrew Website Club where we talk about our websites -no hack is too big or too small
#indieweb @t: Indiewebcamp MIT is coming up on March 14-15th - Gregorian Pi day
#indieweb @t: we have also locked down the dates for Indieweb Summit in Portland indiewebcamp.com/2016 is June 4-5
#indieweb @t: indiewebcamp.com is the indieweb organisation
#indieweb @t: imagine everything that you do on sites like twitter on facebook, but on your own site, and able to do more
#indieweb @t: we already had meetings today in Göteborg in Sweden, Washington DC and have SF and Portland meeting right now
#indieweb @t: looking up this week's news at http://indiewebcamp.com/this-week/2016-02-19.html I see a good article about webmentions: http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/02/18/remember_wordpress_pingbacks_the_w3c_wants_us_to_use_them_across_the_whole_web/
#indieweb Moshe: I do sumi painting- Japanese calligraphy and I was wanting my site http://moshecohen.net to reflect that
#indieweb Moshe: I work between clown and Zen, and I want to do something more composed
#indieweb @kevinmarks: this week I made svgur.com publish webmention links in the head for svg fiels as well as html pages
#indieweb @erinjo: I am now scanning all the books that I own with barcodes and showing them on my site at http://erinjorichey.com/library
#indieweb @erinjo: at the moment I am doing this for physical books first but I am goign to add my ebooks too
#indieweb @erinjo: this is a fork of a lending library project on github, whixh is linked from the bottom of the page
#indieweb @benwerd: Telegram is an allegedly encrypted open IM client that is the new chat
#indieweb @erinjo: the elections are happening in Iran right now and everyone is using telegram to discuss who they are voting for
#indieweb @benwerd: speaking of freedom - a friend of mine in Bangalore got in touch over the students being jailed in Delhi
#indieweb @benwerd: so to track this I built jnu.benwerd.com to track all the news stories of protests in Delhi
#indieweb @benwerd: As well as links to the story it grabs screenshots of the news stories and caches them in case they go down
#indieweb @benwerd: this is a living archive as an extension to known -it can take in any RSS, Atom or h-feed and cache them as images
#indieweb @benwerd: I integrated Joshua the chat bot I showed before with MMS and SMS and slack so I can ask if it is safe to leave mozilla
#indieweb @t: her's a video I posted to my site from tennessee valley beach http://tantek.com/2016/055/t12/fast-walk-hike-beach-video
#indieweb @t: I used brid.gy publish to POSSE the video from my site to twitter, facebook and flickr
#indieweb @t: note that the silo copies are now private to friends only on my social media copies, but public on my own site
#indieweb @t: Note that as @kevinmarks said earlier the silos do autoplay video silently, with a click to show audio. 
#indieweb @t: we should suggest an extension to the <video> tag controls property for muted autoplay video
