<h2>Doc Searls VC Panel</h2>
<a class='h-card' href='http://searls.com'>Doc Searls</a>:  <blockquote><p>this is an unconference, so we don't have panels, and yet here we are with a VC panel because someone made it
<p>identity is rock that the computer industry has been pushing up a hill for years
<p>How can we solve problems in the marketplace by focusing on the individual rather than the institution?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.teare.com'>Keith Teare</a>:  <blockquote><p>I have got many bruises from identity, and I don't know how to solve it. Real Names was meant for non-english name mapping
<p>we built a startup called Contact Card that was supposed to let people be contacted without email everyone as a url
<p>I have my own URL at <a class="auto-link" href="http://teare.com/keith">teare.com/keith</a> where you can chat with me - but the chat service is centralised
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://startupgrind.com/'>Derek Andersen</a>:  <blockquote><p>I don't trust anyone to centralise my identity, not google, not facebook. we're seeing more anonymous sites #indieweb
<p>When somebody has that much power over our identities, they will en dup using it for evil #indieweb
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.javelinvp.com'>Noah Doyle</a>:  <blockquote><p>we have an investment in a company called spike that puts a browser in the cloud that goes away when you stop using it
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://searls.com'>Doc Searls</a>:  <blockquote><p>has the investment environment changed after Snowden?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.teare.com'>Keith Teare</a>:  <blockquote><p>there's an app called <a class="auto-link" href="http://cover.me">cover.me</a> that is a cloaking app that wraps chat and photo-sharing in encryption, based in China
<p>I used to be a Trotskyist - you read all the books and repeat the quotes and a good idea becomes dogma
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://startupgrind.com/'>Derek Andersen</a>:  <blockquote><p>if you pay for something you immediately think it is worth more than something for free
<p>ask customers "how much would you pay for this?" so you have a biz model on the first day
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.teare.com'>Keith Teare</a>:  <blockquote><p>systems that depend on attention form people to grow are hard to combine with payment - eg <a class="auto-link" href="http://app.net">app.net</a>, <a class="auto-link" href="http://just.me">just.me</a>
<p>Twitter is popular and free, but they put crap in front of you all the time, to get your attention
<p>I'm forced into crowd funding. We have 14 companies at Archimedes Labs and they all had trouble being funded
<p>there are now 3 kinds of seed: Family Seed, Pre-Seed and Seed
<p>No-one funds an idea any more, you have to get it up and running for free
<p>you can get a little bit of money for a prototype, maybe $100k, but then you need to get traction
<p>If you get traction, the growth capital is unlimited - you'll get $100M
<p>This encourages small ideas done quickly, not things that take tome to groe.
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://searls.com'>Doc Searls</a>:  <blockquote><p>You could poison an idea with a bad implementation?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.teare.com'>Keith Teare</a>:  <blockquote><p>After Yuri Milner invested in Facebook late, he made all the VCs switch to Growth Funds and be Private Equity
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://startupgrind.com/'>Derek Andersen</a>:  <blockquote><p>there are lots of indicators for traction - eg Y Combinator counts as traction. 
<p>You can get funding if you have a track record, but never if you're unknown
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.teare.com'>Keith Teare</a>:  <blockquote><p>if someone takes 10% of your company and expects something in 3 months, you will build a small idea
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href=''>Amit Shah</a>:  <blockquote><p>there is not a true distributed net. The routers are controlled by a few people.
<p>I'm not worried by the advertising model - that is dying a natural death. we're moving to real solutions
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.teare.com'>Keith Teare</a>:  <blockquote><p>Google's biz model depends on searches from laptops and desktops - we do less searching on mobile it's an app world there
<p>we're beginning to see infrastructure as a service for mobile like Parse, Urban Airship take off
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href=''>Anandan Jayaraman</a>:  <blockquote><p>finding liquidity is the hard thing for these models - can it be embedded elsewhere to grow?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href=''>Amit Shah</a>:  <blockquote><p>we're looking for ideas that re unique, not me too ideas. We like defensibility, so don't do apps
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href=''>Don Gordon</a>:  <blockquote><p>I have an interest in SMB apps and there is a lot of VRM there, if you can give then new independence from big vendors
<p></blockquote>
