<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>welcome to the homebrew website club, come demo your websites and ask for help with your site
<p>that last 2 days have been the #SocialWG meeting of the w3c on social web standards
<p><a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/kylewmahan">@kylewmahan</a> posted about how silo.pub can now post to new silos
<p>tomorrow is San Francisco indiewebcamp <a class="auto-link" href="http://indiewebcamp.com/2015/SF">http://indiewebcamp.com/2015/SF</a> - come to mozilla tomorrow morning and hack
<p>and we are doing commitments to update our sites by the end of the year, like we did last year
<p>one thing I am trying to get working is person tagging people in posts on my site so that <a class="auto-link" href="http://brid.gy">brid.gy</a> will tag them on FB too
<p>I use instagram to post photos which PESOS in via <a class="auto-link" href="http://ownyourgram.com">ownyourgram.com</a> so I can POSSE back out to facebook
<p>at first I'm going to have to manually person tag them with their personal urls and their fb and twitter urls
<p>I will probably start with a manual nicknames cache on my site which has their URLs
<p>correction: I am not using ownyourgram - I am manually PESOSing from instagram

<p>many months ago I decided to rewrite my website from scratch, which is never a good idea
<p>I'm in progress since April - my 2016 commitment is to finish this website rewrite
<p>my site supports webmention sending and retrieving, it supports micropub and person tagging
<p>what I am trying to do is make every feature of my site a service other people can use too
<p>I am switching to use my other site <a class="auto-link" href="http://webmention.io">webmention.io</a> for webmentions on my own site. I recently added a webhook for data
<p>so when <a class="auto-link" href="http://webmention.io">webmention.io</a> receives a webmention, I get a well-formed webhook notifying me of the mention
<p>this payload format is jf2 - a simplified json representation of the microformats parsed result
<p>there is a test suite for <a class="auto-link" href="http://webmention.io">webmention.io</a> now that passes. I am using this service for my new site
<p>I have infinite scroll without the automation, but a load more link
<p>I hope that these service will be useful for other people too
<p>part of my new site is a nicknames cache so I can look up people that I mention, but they have their own page
<p>I am getting homepage notifications from <a class="auto-link" href="http://brid.gy">brid.gy</a> from Kevin's tweets which are showing up on my screen and watch
<p>I am expecting to make this a profile discovery service that other people can use as well
<p>I have a venue on my site so I can say <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/home">@home</a> as well as the nicknames I use for people
<p>I'm going to be using Quill to post so I will use quill to use the name cache. 
<p>I'm trying to not buld things into my site so I end up using these decentralised tools

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://kylewm.com'>Kyle Mahan</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>this isn't on my site but it will be eventually. A while ago Kevin nerdsniped me into building silo.pub
<p>you can use Quill to post to hosted sites. A week and a half ago I got excited about using it to POSSE to twitter
<p>now I added facebook as well. So it gives me a proxy homepage for facebook so that I can use that with micropub
<p>I have to use the ugly id that facebook gives me because it won't map the human readable name any more
<p>as silo.pub already has authorization, I am only doing authentication this time
<p>the difference between brid,gy publish and silo.pub is that bridgy just reads your site, but doesn't know to remap
<p>ryan has been resisting making <a class="auto-link" href="http://brid.gy">brid.gy</a> do more smarts; silo.pub is more simple now, but you have mroe control

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>as much as POSSE is our way to federate with silos, you're now using micropub as a federation protocol
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.w3.org/People/Sandro/'>Sandro Hawke</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>this is not quite federation in the #socialwg way as it is to another account of yours
<p>maybe we need a use case for someone having more than one account on different sites
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://kylewm.com'>Kyle Mahan</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I could have 'add a micropub endpoint' so it proxies these for you
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://kevinmarks.com'>Kevin Marks</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>Quill could look fro the rel-me links and suggest the silo.pub proxies
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://aaronparecki.com/'>Aaron Parecki</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>that could be a fun thing to do tomorrow at indiewebcamp

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://darius.dunlaps.net'>Darius Dunlap</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>My goal for the end of the year is to reimplement the square peg foundation website
<p>I'm also planning to revive my food blog too
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://kevinmarks.com'>Kevin Marks</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I built a webmention endpoint at <a class="auto-link" href="http://mention-tech.appspot.com">http://mention-tech.appspot.com</a> that will receive webmentions for any site and verify them
<p>if the source verifies it looks for a webmention endpoint in the target and sends it on to that site
<p>I ended up doing this because when I showed <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/t">@t</a> the site he thought hat was what it did, so I followed user testing
