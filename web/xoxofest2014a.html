<a class='h-card' href='http://waxy.org/'>Andy Baio</a>:  <blockquote><p>I was having so much fun last night I forgot to eat, so I ended up making ramen noodles in Plaid Pantry at 3am
<p>Ben Purdy, <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/purdybot">@purdybot</a>, made all our projected visualisations - hire him to do things for you
<p><a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/stewart">@stewart</a> Butterfield from <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/slackhq">@slackhq</a> bought a lot of fans from chinatown - grab one to cool yourself
<p>Erin McKean is a lexicographer, former editor of the Oxford American Dictionary and founded wordnik
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.wordnik.com'>Erin McKean</a>:  <blockquote><p>I am the female founder of a Silicon Valley VC-backed startup that has nothing to do with fashion
<p>become an expert in a mundane object that is made in an arcane way
<p>give a talk at conference you haven't heard of and use the word synecdoche in it
<p>Independence is a myth - we valorize it, but in the vacuum of space no-one can help you make
<p>unless you're independently wealthy and incredibly reclusive, you're dependent on somobody
<p>when I started wordnik I knew a lot of things, but those things were mostly about dictionaries
<p>I wanted every word, with meaning shown by usage and yes, EVERY word
<p>wordnik's  business model 1. Collect words 2. ? 3. Profit
<p>I didn't think there would be a thousand twitter bots like <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/metaphorminute">@metaphorminute</a>
<p>we built reverb which finds things you are interested in based on word knowledge
<p>when you fall in love with someone you need to look at them and say "this is the problem I want to have"
<p>investors want you to get big. I want to build a map of the English language at a scale of 1:1 so that  fits
<p>I had a bias that I liked people with strong opinions, but it took a while to realize that assholes have them too
<p>when you have a little kid you are "I control your universe" but as they get older they get more indpendent
<p>it can be hard to realise that something that can't have a life without you is a parasite
<p>I dream of running away to Portland where I can write artisanal javascript and work on my 2nd novelâ€¦
<p>If I've learned something in a day, the day is not a total waste. Even if it is Baconadoes
<p>Feeling incompetent is exhausting. Occasionally indulge in meaningless competence
<p>There's no words involved in Sudoku - what's the actual point?
<p>my meaningless competence is making dresses - I don't want them to become a job
<p>People like to tell me "you're too nice" -so  I attempted to have a bitch face for a while
<p>I reached back into my ancestral knowledge and realised you can weaponize nice
<p>if you weaponize nice you can tell someone to go to hell and they'll enjoy the trip
<p>it's entirely possible to be empathetic to someone but not put their needs above your own
<p></blockquote>

<p><a class='h-card' href='http://links.net'>Justin Hall</a>:  <blockquote><p>20 years ago you could surf the whole web in a couple of weekends, so I decided to join in
<p>Links from the underground led to me having visitors to my website, so I started to tell the story of my life 
<p>I had 27000 daily readers in 1995
<p>By a series of  hard work over 20 years, I've been able to take the 27,000 daily readers and get those today to 250 daily  
<p>In 3rd grade my father died. When you're 8 years old, that disconnects you from your peers 
<p>I wrestled a lot with that "Why did my father kill himself?" question on my website 
<p>Talking about this online meant I got responses from other people who had lost their fathers too, and eased their pain
<p>I shared my bad grades from school, my Lsd trips and my sexually transmitted disease 
<p>People kept sending me stories in response to mine,  so I decided to teach people to make their own websites #indieweb 
<p>I toured the us by greyhound bus and taught people how to make websites 
<p>I hoped that Strangers+honesty = empathy - that's been a mixed bag
<p>When we got search engines, it went from looking for weird shut to searching for something else and finding weird shit 
<p>I assumed that knowing me was consent to be written about in public online
<p>I had to learn to stop using people's names, and details  when writing on the web 
<p>A commenter explained that I was incapable of being in a relationship, with citations to my writings 
<p>I chose my relationship over personal media production. That relationship ended in divorce. 
<p>I took time to digest and then made a video talking about my divorce without identifying my ex
<p>When my startup  gamelayers failed I wrote up what went wrong  <a class="auto-link" href="http://links.net/vita/gamelayers">links.net/vita/gamelayers</a> 
<p>I  started out believing in honesty  play and participation online, but what I was missing was relationship

<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.commonplacebooks.com'>Joseph Fink</a>:  <blockquote><p>I don't have the kind of talk that has slides,  so I have some random photos instead 
<p>I want to talk about sudden success. My friends and I made a podcast, and we still do. 
<p>I used to stand in the street trying to convince people to switch electric companies 
<p>We made welcome to night Vale - a podcast set in a fictional village in the desert with angels and ghosts 
<p>At the 1 year mark we had 150,000 downloads, the next month we had 2.5 million downloads
<p>I got an email from an agent wanting me to work on television while at my table in the street 
<p>What I'm saying is that I went from a a bad job to a good job and I'm happy about it
<p>Success turned my friends into my co workers. The relationship I had with them before is gone 
<p>There are  now thousands and thousands of people who are waiting for our work and that is rereidying
<p>By being white and male, Jeffrey and I have avoided most of the horrible things that come  with sudden success 
<p>There are over 4000 works of welcome to  night Vale fan fiction. I won't read any of them but I'm glad they are there 
<p>Our characters are drawn  in sound, we don't describe them, and fans make their own pictures on tumblr 
<p>The fans still want us to settle their debates over what the characters look like, even though we don't know 
<p>There was an amazing lag between the fans appearing and our making anything from it 
<p>Success can only come if you throw yourself into it recklessly, if you make the things you talk about making 
<p>The success of Night Vale was good for us because we were making something that we wanted to with people we wanted to 
<p>Make things you like, with people you like, treat them with respect, and if you make any money from it, pay them

<a class='h-card' href='http://waxy.org/'>Andy Baio</a>:  <blockquote><p>there is a Gamergate truther guy handing out his Jack Chick pamphlets over by the goats 
<p>I have a metric for a healthy community - how quickly do they self-organise and meet offline?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://ednapiranha.com'>Parody Cult Expert</a>:  <blockquote><p>I will tell you the story of how meatspace started
<p>I work on a lot of chat experiments, and my friend was doing WebRTC stuff, so we got animated gifs of users faces
<p>so you have a chat with a looping animated gif of your face underneath the text
<p>we got 3000 users in 1 day, it was a single channel, it was a mess and everyone was saying they were addicted
<p>we were expecting a lot of genitalia, yet I've only seen 3 penises on there, which isn't bad
<p>I didn't want to build an irc clone with channels, and I didn't want authentication
<p>your face being on there is your identification
<p>I forced everybody to be in a single room so everyone has to deal with it
<p>human relationships don't scale, you can't have 5000 close friends
<p>to get rid of the trolly people who taped over their cams and abuse you, so we added muting
<p>the users hung out together and got to know one another and met up in SF and NY
<p>there was an article in a French womens magazine so it filled up with French college girls and worried the Americans
<p>so I made a separate space for the French women, and an international one
<p>there was then a Paris-based meet up too
<p>I started paying attention to the communities and working on how to deal with trolly people by muting them
<p>we had some problems with regular trolls who came back and abuse people, so we added a temporary hellban
<p>trusted admins can ban them for 1 hour - no-one sees them but themselves
<p>we make it an hour so people can get a second chance, because sometimes they're just scared and acting up. I used to.
<p>Its an open source system, so if you ran your own copy I don't know if you would get the same community - try it
<p>the messages last 10 minutes, so it is ephemeral like conversation, though anyone could copy it
<p>people made games with the gifs where they completed each others bodies
<p>I'm doing a new project that applies glitch filters to images, and we all got ourselves glitched up twitter avatars
<p>things can grow from something that you didn't expect. Once you get that growth it's about maintaining the community
<p>having pods of communities and sub-communities and letting do their own thing is important

<a class='h-card' href='http://waxy.org/'>Andy Baio</a>:  <blockquote><p>the next speaker has done a lot of clever hacks and twitter bots - Darius Kazemi
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://tinysubversions.com'>Darius Kazemi</a>:  <blockquote><p>ever since I was a child, I wanted to win the lottery. 
<p>At my grandma's we watched the news for the pennsylvania lottery and watched the ball be revealed. She never one
<p>the lottery became a way for processing what happened every day
<p>I got into a fender bender, and used the number of the other guys car
<p>If I got a girls number in a bar, I would play her phone number
<p>I started to share my lottery numbers with my daily lottery blog
<p>by being a content creator like this I built up a community of fans
<p>at the time none of us could get a gig - we weren't well-known lottery players
<p>I worked at The Lottery Collective for a few years. It wasa 1 in a million experience
<p>a lot of people in the creative world don't like to talk numbers
<p>here are my numbers 03 09 19 23 29 39 - you'll see a lot of 9s and a surprising number of 3s
<p>I'm not saying you should play 9s and 3s. They worked for me, but they might not work for you. Try something wild 
<p>I wrote this talk on the flight home from XOXO last year
<p>beyond a certain threshold of work you put in, success is entirely out of your hands
<p>creative work and putting it online is buying the lottery ticket
<p>I made <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/MiraculousPics">@MiraculousPics</a> which si a parody of those annoying picture accounts
<p>It grabs captions from those scummy photo sites and does a google image search and posts it
<p><a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/AU_prompts">@AU_prompts</a> creates crossover alternate universe fanfic prompts by taking 2 characters and an aspiration
<p><a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/4myrealfriends">@4myrealfriends</a> uses <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/wordnik">@wordnik</a> - thanks Erin - to get bigrams to get tuernabout quotes
<p><a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/twoheadlines">@twoheadlines</a> mixes 2 headlines from 2 google news categories "China to remain an American company"
<p>I buy a lot of lottery tickets - I make a lot of these bots 112 recently, and got about 9 well-known ones
<p>creative recognition is largely a matter of luck. Marketing, PR is just buying more lottery tickets
<p>the most successful kickstarter ever raised $13M for the coolest cooler. 
<p>this may seem like fatalism, and in a sense it is.
<p>2 kinds of creative advice: how to buy more lottery tickets, and how to win the lottery. The 1st is useful the 2nd is nonsense

<a class='h-card' href='http://waxy.org/'>Andy Baio</a>:  <blockquote><p>we flew Leigh Alexander in from London because we love her - she writes about games but draws on other genres
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://leighalexander.net/'>Leigh Alexander</a>:  <blockquote><p>my work focuses on the way technology interacts with storytelling and play and fantasy
<p>I have an acting degree, I ended up an office assistant, and writing was a way out of that
<p>the market for games writing is very challenging, as many people want to write about video games all day
<p>I feel lucky as an exception to many rules - I make a living from being freelance; as a women in gaming
<p>most writing about gaming is technology products reviews - buyers guides
<p>around the turn of the millennium writing about games as culture started happening
<p>if you look at what you commonly hear and read about video games, it doesn't represent all the games I love
<p>my first blog <a class="auto-link" href="http://sexyvideogameland.blogspot.com">sexyvideogameland.blogspot.com</a> - I wrote every day covering games with a broader perspective
<p>it became important to me to always maintain a blog and have my own voice as well as a corporate byline
<p>I want everyone to see games the way I see them as beautiful and wonderful
<p>I want people to stop thinking of writing about gaming as being an arrested child
<p>I knew that games were not going to have a healthy community until we solved the diversity and inclusivity problems
<p>I write about the things I'm interested in the games I care about and what I think should succeed. That's the agenda
<p>my approach puts me at extreme odds with the gamer fan-type figure - despite this I find an audience fro my work
<p>I'm facing the same economic constraints as anyone else who writes for a living
<p>after a abad experience with Thought Catalog with Breathing Machines, I decided to publish my own books
<p>I published my own book Clipping Through <a class="auto-link" href="https://gumroad.com/l/aisCU">https://gumroad.com/l/aisCU</a> and have made more from that already than tha last
<p>I have my book up at $5 or pay what you want and most people are paying more than $5 for it
<p>games are just starting to reach their full potential now - reaching the mainstream
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.hankgreen.com'>Hank Green</a>:  <blockquote><p>I make internet video. We started about 8 years ago, when there wasn't a way to monetize or many people to watch it
<p>our videos have been viewed about 800,000 times, at 5 mins each that is four billion minutes
<p>I have killed four billion minutes of human lifetimes, which is about 85 lives.
<p>Have I done 85 human lifetimes of good? that's that keeps me up.
<p>if you want to get a popular youtube channel, go back in time 8 years and start one then
<p>I have a 2 step process: 1. get a community of 200,000 fans who agree with you 2. use them for everything else
<p>I want to talk about your dreams. [slide with giant text FUCK YOUR DREAMS]
<p>when I was in 8th grade I somehow decided that I wanted to be an oceanographer
<p>they got us to write haikus in school and I wrote "Oceanographer/that's what I want to be/Oceanographer"
<p>it was 5 years into the process of making video blogs I realised I loved editing video
<p>i do a lot of science video stuff, and I recently got the chance of a TV show explaining science, which 4 years ago Hank
<p>there is one person objectively I can say that I am smarter than, and that is me 4 years ago
<p>I wanted to be the guy who solved death. Being that guy would be a kind of immortality. Along with the real immortality.
<p>moments of extreme success are depression triggers for me. 3 days later I can't get out of bed. WHAT THE FUCK?
<p>dreams decrease the total number of potential paths - you miss other directions
<p>you don't really want an Oscar, you want recognition from your peers
<p>you don't want to be bought by Google, you want a big fucking pile of money
<p>Dreams shouldl fuel you, not define you

<a class='h-card' href='http://ftrain.com'>Paul Ford</a>:  <blockquote><p>I'm going to talk about 5 websites that I have built of the last 18 years
<p>This talk is called "building your personal platform." I'm sorry.
<p>the first site I built was <a class="auto-link" href="http://ftrain.com">ftrain.com</a>: from 1997 to today it has been hanging out. I haven't updated it in a year
<p>you put a bunch of stuff up on line and give it away for free and people scream at you
<p>I got an email one day asking if I would like to make a website for Harpers magazine
<p>the thing Harpers didn't tell me is the publisher hates the internet
<p>Harpers softball shirts have "fuck the internet" on the back - and I was the web guy
<p>the best rule of editing I learned at Harpers is "keep like with like"
<p>I scanned the archives of Harpers and tagged the keywords in the stories so we could compile timelines
<p>I realised I was having a major depressive episode when I looked at the train and thought I should be in front of it
<p>I built another site <a class="auto-link" href="http://ohlih.com">ohlih.com</a> and made a diary and enabled me to track calories
<p>another secret website - <a class="auto-link" href="http://anxietybox.com">anxietybox.com</a> - you put in your name, your email and your anxiety, and it emails you mean notes
<p>then you can email back and discipline your anxiety,.
<p>your worst anxieties make great bots because they are shrieking monsters saying the same thing over and over
<p>Poetry break: <a class="auto-link" href="http://www.gratefulness.org/poetry/guest_house.htm">http://www.gratefulness.org/poetry/guest_house.htm</a> by Rumi
<p>I looked back at these sites and wondered what they have in common, and it is change over time
<p>I did that thing you should never do - I thought "i'll just make a note taking app"
<p>this <a class="auto-link" href="http://unscroll.com">unscroll.com</a> is a timeline and it shows me things I searcg for over time egold radio shows
<p>my friend Leslie Harpold died.  I imported her blog into <a class="auto-link" href="http://unscroll.com">unscroll.com</a> so I an take notes on her posts
<p>The goal of this site is to work on it for 20 years

<p>we'd like to dedicate this festival to someone that we lost this year, to Chloe Weil.
<p>independence is hard and independence is lonely. 
<p>we just want you to know that you are not alone. Everyone of you needs to know that.
