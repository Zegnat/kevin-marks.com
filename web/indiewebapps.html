<p><a class='h-card' href='http://aaronparecki.com'>Aaron Parecki</a>:  <blockquote><p>it's not reasonable for everyone to build interfaces for everything on their site - you may want to share photo UI
<p>if you go to aaronparecki.com/metrics you can see my pushups; I wrote an iPhone app that counts pushups with my nose
<p>as an app developer I get to write an iPhone app without a backend service as it just post to your site
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://upon2020.com/'>Johannes Ernst</a>:  <blockquote><p>you just have to enter a URL, not a username and password too
<p>if your phone knew your domain, it could auth this without even entering a domain
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://aaronparecki.com'>Aaron Parecki</a>:  <blockquote><p>this enables data ownership as well as identity onine
<p>the next one is ownyourgram.com that treats instagram as a client to your site
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://pauloppenheim.com'>pauloppenheim</a>:  <blockquote><p>so you can use instagram effectively as a camera app?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://aaronparecki.com'>Aaron Parecki</a>:  <blockquote><p>I think there are benefits for developers to do just the app, not the backend too
<p>the Feltron logging app will save locally, and sync to either email or dropbox - bring your own backend
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://pauloppenheim.com'>pauloppenheim</a>:  <blockquote><p>pushups with your nose -that's something nobody has seen - it's innovative
<p>there's the Locker project...
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://aaronparecki.com'>Aaron Parecki</a>:  <blockquote><p>there are a lot of apps that pull your info back from silos and aggregate them for you - locker, narrato etc
<p>one of the challenges is that companies want to be the home for your data, not just a creation app
<p>the point of having a cloud service for fitbit/jawbone is to process the raw data into a useful form
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://pauloppenheim.com'>pauloppenheim</a>:  <blockquote><p>the philips hue doesn't have a base station; some services did have this
<p>it depends if they want to make money from selling you the device or from a service
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://aaronparecki.com'>Aaron Parecki</a>:  <blockquote><p>these gadgets sell for $150 because they run a cloud service and don't want to bill you monthly
<p>philips don't want to run a cloud service - the only thing they do is autodiscovery of the IP address for the hub
<p>if you look at micropub, it's a way to create h-entry - published; category; content; name; summary -can add more 
<p>http://indiewebcamp.com/micropub specifies how to send arbitrary properties to the server for a post, with html fallback
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://pauloppenheim.com'>pauloppenheim</a>:  <blockquote><p>there is an idea that log and a database are dual - logs between applications and components
<p>The Log: What every software engineer should know about real-time data http://engineering.linkedin.com/distributed-systems/log-what-every-software-engineer-should-know-about-real-time-datas-unifying
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://kevinmarks.com'>Kevin Marks</a>:  <blockquote><p>a stream API means you don't have to deal with CRUD directly, you can create a view of current state
<p>we have an endless debate about database vs json vs flat file; defining a log stream makes this moot
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://pauloppenheim.com'>pauloppenheim</a>:  <blockquote><p>I have a static page on my domain, and IndieAuth means I can be part of a conversation without code
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://upon2020.com/'>Johannes Ernst</a>:  <blockquote><p>so the IndieWeb is the AirBnB of social networking
