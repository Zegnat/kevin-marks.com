<p>most of the art that I make comes after I have felt anxiety and negative emotions
<p>I was annoyed by myself procrastinating thought "just fucking d oit already" and then wondered why nike owned a phrase
<p>I made a ton of new slogans for companies and tweeted them at them. like Subway: food option™
<p>It doesn't matter if you feel bad when you're working
<p>I briefly mentioned agoraphobia earlier, and I keep making up reasons not to go outside
<p>I got commissioned to do some articles for a magazine so I used it to make myself go outside
<p>when I was a kid I used to crawl around and pretend I was a horse. I have always wished I was a horse
<p>quotes from school essay when she was 9 "I want to be famous for drawing horses one day"
<p>I love westerns but they are so racist and misogynist, and they don't even acknowledge the horses. 
<p>I wanted a surreal horse-focused western with dog people in it, and couldn't find one, so I made it
<p>a friend of mine pitched a TV show about a depressed horse man, and included my drawings, and it got picked up
<p>so I got to art direct it and painted watercolours of the characters
<p>I went to LA to art direct Bojack and it was terrifying, as I had no animation experience but had to work with a team
<p>what I love about working on the show is that it seems like a wacky sitcom at first but it comes from a personal place

<p>when I was a kid I dreamed I'd become a bubblegum dealer, like the Walter White of bubblegum
<p>when I was 10 we moved to Vancouver. To make my parents proud I thought I'd be a doctor and lawyer and sue myself
<p>I did not make my parents proud. I came out as gay to them and I had to leave home. I moved to san francisco
<p>I thought I'd be an independent game developer, but there is alot of anxiety there
<p>life is series of branching possibilities and if you take the wrong path the whole thing could go wrong.
<p>today I'm going to butcher chaos theory to explain how my life is unpredictable
<p>halfway through 2014 I was working on my independent game, and it had money rasied and so on
<p>I made a small side project to show how lighting worked in my game, and then went back to the same game
<p>but then for a game jam I made the "coming out simulator" that built on my experience coming out to my parents
<p>I made a branching narrative, but I didn't want to make too many branches, so I made some choices have subtle effects
<p>I published that and ti dis really well - got half a million plays and was helping very many people
<p>I got letters from people all over the world saying "coming out simulator" had helped them
<p>before I made it I only knew one version of the story, but for the game I had to see what other possibilities existed
<p>remember that interactive explainer I told you about a few minutes ago? good times
<p>the explainer got some publicity and I ended up making parable of the polygons with vi hart  <a class="auto-link" href="http://ncase.me/polygons/">http://ncase.me/polygons/</a>
<p>parable of the polygons did well, so I ended up making more of these
<p>I'm doing one on social media - who'd have thought that social media that exposes people leaves them feeling exposed
<p>related to systems theory is chaos theory, and you can think of evolution as properly harnessed chaos
<p>I finally killed the game project and I refunded everybody and gave a long explanation of why
<p>surprisingly they were really supportive, Who knew that killing your dreams could be such fun?
<p>I wasn't unproductive, but I was anxious. but then I learned about chaos theory from wikipedia
<p>so now instead of getting rid of Chaos, we should learn to live with it
<p>kill your dreams. Actually, serial kill your dreams, Up close they don't look good
<p>so experiment, improvise, and adapt to present chaos
<p>I had not been in contact with my family for a year, but I felt well enough to reach out and see them again
<p>we hung out at the Portland art museum and saw Kinsuge the japanese art of mending what you fucked up and broke
<p>You don't hide the scar, you highlight it with gold, to show you repaired it
<p>damage is a part of you, and you can make something from the broken pieces
<p>I'm not glamourising trauma and saying "to be a true artiste you have to suffer for your art"
<p>I'm saying that you can't go back but there are lots of ways to go forward
<p>There is no way to go back, but every way to go forward

That's not a joke - last year I applied and got denied.
<p>I tweeted that I was coming to XOXO, and was told that my kind was not supposed to be here. but I came anyway
<p>I'm not really supposed to be here as a VC either - I'm not an MBA from stanford but an mormon from SLC
<p>Andy told me that he didn't like the name <a class="auto-link" href="http://indie.vc">indie.vc</a> - that sin't supposed to fit
<p>we can't talk about venture capital without talking about unicorns
<p>the VC theory was that there were 6 companies a year that mattered - the ones that make $100M revenue or $1B value
<p>without one of those you'd never make back your fund
<p>Aileen Lee did the work to see how this really works, and found it was 4 a year and 99.93% of VCs companies failed
<p>in effect as a VC I have a product that doesn't work for 99.93% of my csutomers
<p>we create the Entrepreneurial Industrial Complex that defines what a unicorn founder is supposed to look like
<p>we now have entrepreneurs that are building companies, interacting with their users, solely to appeal to VC
<p>A while back we started OATV with Tim O'Reilly and Marc Jacobson. We saw all the cost of starting a company going down
<p>what if we could fund people who normally wouldn't have access to this kind of funding?
<p>what if we could fund with smaller amounts of money the companies that VCs won't invest in
<p>when we were raising the fund we had a lot of conversations about Bill O'Reilly because they didn't know who we are
<p>the problem was that we were seed funding companies that had to go to VCs for next rounds, the VCs didn't want to follow on
<p>pour some out for Wesabe, Chumby, GetSatisfaction, PMOG
<p>we did invest in a bunch of things that worked too, but those companies had to look like and act like unicorns for VCs
<p>other people's money is an addictive substance
<p>one of our founders said "I never want to raise any more money" after we funded him. Now he has raised $200M 
<p>Now he has a board full of VCs and none of the people he started with still work there.
<p>In 2012 we were raising our 3rd fund and I was having a midlife crisis about my job. Did we do what we set out to do?
<p>the reality was no. our funds did well, people wanted to invest, and we were turning money away
<p>we told them we wanted to do an experiment. Are any of the things we thought at the beginning not true?
<p>What fi we surrounded our founders whe didn't focus on funding and valuation but revenue and customers? 
<p>what if we changed what the archetype of success looked like?
<p>what if instead of trying to force everyone into a billion dollar company or collateral damage, we focused on profitable
<p>the types of founders coming into entrepreneurship was changing, being more diverse
<p>there were also founders who had done the venture thing and wanted to try something else
<p>marc hedland eventully told me "just ship"
<p>January 1 of 2015 I sent a note to 5 people and asked them to pass it on, so we can find 8 people
<p>I sent it at 9am on January 1st. by midday it was everywhere, and we had hundreds apply
<p>the challenge is that when your product is giving people money, product market fit is hard to guage
<p>for $100,000 we don't take equity, unless you raise further VC. if you pay yourself > 150% of market it's a distribution
<p>if it's a distribution, we start off taking 80% and you get 20% then it moves to the other way round and capped at 5x 
<p>we made a declaration of independence that said the product shouldn't be killed when you're bought by yahoo
<p>the response from female entrepreneurs was overwhelming
<p>of the 9 companies 5 had female founders, and 2 of them were black women
<p>we're 9 months in, and the best way to show that this is a good idea is to show results
<p>the companies are building real things and growing revenue.
<p>one of the companies is called Storq - products for expectant mums and new parents
<p>the shade room is a startup that is a pace for black people to speak.
<p>the revenue of shade room is up more than anyone else in the group's now
<p>the biggest LP passed - we have support from other investors; we hope to get it closed by the end of october, come talk

<p>I got stuck with SmoothieFreak as a name on YouTube because I made a bad choice and then din't ever change it
<p>I started making comedy videos in 2012; I made over 100 of them, but none of them went viral
<p>I know that I'm funny. I'm not showing off; you know when you are
<p>I realised I was doing youtube wrong because I was trying to be popular instead of be funny
<p>so I made that "your 1st black girlfriend" video after my white boyfriend flaked on me & it was the most popular
<p>if you're over he age of 17 and say you're a Youtuber it's like saying amateur porn star or cat viner
<p>YouTube is not a platform; it has a connotation. So I now call myself a comedian, not a youtuber
<p>when I'm on a standup roster they now look down at me too
<p>no-one is more self-made than when you film in a dark room and then spend all weekend pantsless editing it
<p>Comedy thinks Youtube isn't real, TV thinks the internet is a phase
<p>the time you spend trying to get people to respect you is when you don't have a chance of getting it
<p>When you define success you're more likely to achieve it.
<p>if you can't make something that you're proud of when it is only you and your mom commenting on it, don't do it
<p>no-one likes blogging any more. I don't care what you did today, just send me a text with some emoji in
<p>ask yourself: "Will anyone be into this in a year?" "does this appeal to me or is it just popular?"
<p>the metric for success can be anything 
<p>it's not how many people view it, it's the calibre of the people who share it and comment
<p>I'ma big fan of Oprah, and she said "follow your bliss" and people say "i followed it and I'm poor"
<p>what Oprah meant was "if what you're doing is should sucking, stop doing it"
<p>"Once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand." - Velveteen Rabbit
<p>the moment that things stopped mattering was the moment that everything started happening

<p>I keep getting questions about how to engage with other people online
<p>there is now so much more at stake online - we spend ages curating a persona online and it affects a lot
<p>this guy was applying for a job and accidentally sent a nude selfie to the HR manager
<p>the negative effects of these things show up when they are stripped from context
<p>some fraction of the internet just show me of a gif, which is from a blooper reel 
<p>I was wearing a Cthulu in glasses t-shirt, and I jiggled to make Cthulu swim
<p>this guy pasted a video entitled 'victoria belmont boobies ftw' and got 450,000 views for it
<p>then the gif got cropped out of it and lost all context. This is my internet cockroach
<p>every time I do anything online that gif of 7 years ago me follows me around 
<p><a class="auto-link" href="http://xkcd.com/386">xkcd.com/386</a> applies - I want so badly to give context to these aresholes
<p>probably all of you have something like this out there that could follow you around too
<p>we haven't found a way to emotionally process this invincible and perfect memory online
<p>my friend dawn said 'over time this won't matter because we all have those things from the past'
<p>when we have to make particularly quick decisions the ability to have empathy is dramatically reduced
<p>there's only oen way for me to not lose my temper over this every time, is to have empathy with them
<p>schools are staring to teach empathy, maybe that can work

<p>this story starts a long time ago, when I dropped out of college and made my startup on a pong pong table
<p>and then the VC bubble burst, and at 19 I learned how to lay someone off so they were least likely to become violent
<p>I laid off 20 of my friends and 7 of us kept it going for another year  until i went back to college 
<p>but photojojo was different - this was 2006, and it started as a side project with tips for photos
<p>when I moved to san francisco it was becasue I was ready to take photojojo seriously
<p>we would host these photo walks where 150 people would show up to walk around and take photos
<p>This time I was cautious. before I put up a job listing I saved up a year of salary so I wouldn't have to lay them off
<p>So I'd been living in san francisco for 6 years, so I went to my doctor, and he told me I had leukemia, not mono
<p>So, I had to start treatment at once or I'd be dead in 2 weeks
<p>I spent the night in SF hospital and flew in a medical flight to the east coast to be with my parents
<p>I saw a wall of machines that were supposed to keep me alive as my organs failed
<p>my doctors ran blood tests every 3 or 4 hours all day and night
<p>The cure was maybe a stem cell transplant, but they wouldn't tell me the odds, so I googled
<p>and if I had a perfect match from a perfect donor, I had a 50% chance of surviving 5 years
<p>and there was a 1 in 10000 chance of a match and they checked, and there wasn't one
<p>I cried and cried. I wondered why I had spent so much time on facebook and twitter
<p>I had wanted to adopt a dog, I wanted to learn to draw. I'd always wanted a DeLorean…
<p>and what about PhotoJojo? I'd never set it up for anyone else to take over
<p>so I wrote a will, and set up a power of attorney, and emailed my friends
<p>and then something amazing happened - my friends made "amit gupta needs you" website
<p>and they set up national bone marrow drives so people could swab their cheeks to see if they were a match for me
<p>or a match for anyone else who needed a stem cell transplant
<p>I am doing news interviews from my hospital bed as teh drives take off
<p>and 3 months go by and I'm having chemo every day, and it attacks my corneas and I go blind for 3 days
<p>and then they find a match. A perfect match,
<p>They give me the biggest dose of chemo they can possibly give a human to kill all the cancer cells
<p>and my angel donor in New York sends me their stem cells, and the cells drip into my body
<p>that high dose of chemo also killed my bone marrow so if this doesn't take I am doomed
<p>3 weeks go by and it starts to work. My body starts making white cells and red cells and it works
<p>my new blood has my donors DNA, and the rest of my cells have my DNA so I am a living science project
<p>my blood thinks my body is a disease, and I am on immune supressors to stop them fighting
<p>and a year later I am back in San Francisco, and I don't want to be there any more. I want to leave Photojojo
<p>I want to make myself unnecessary, so I can leave Photojojo. I am planning my escape.
<p>then I find someone, I spend a year, I meet him and his family and then I sell Photojojo 
<p>and then I sell everything I own and leave San Francisco.
<p>Photojojo is doing great now.
<p>I di some travelling, I took those drawing lessons, I went to india and took meditation lessons
<p>I adopted that dog. I didn't get the DeLorean, but I did get a great Motorcycle though.
<p>”We must be willing to let go of the life we've planned so as to have the life that is waiting for us” Joseph Campbell
<p>If your work is important to you, plan for the end. For the day that you aren't able to do it any more.
<p>You don't get forever. We try to eat better, exercise, use a standing desk to live longer. And it works
<p>I want you to imagine that you got that call from the doctor. What are the 3 things you'd regret?
<p>is there one of those 3 thinsg that you could start when you get home from this next week. just one.
<p>You already know what you shoudl do
<p>I would love to hear form you when you do these things. I'm still on twitter, unfortunately.
<p>Do those things. thank you very much.

<div class='h-cite'><span class='hovercard'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://seriouspony.com/'>Kathy Sierra</a><iframe class='u-hovercard hidden-info' height=128 width=256 src='http://www.unmung.com/hovercard?url=http%3A%2F%2Fseriouspony.com%2F'></iframe></span>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I've never started a presentation with tears in my eyes. This is really awkwardly upbeat. But I think it's important
<p>Imagine someone says "I'm writing a book… to make money"
<p>we all want artists to be paid, but it sounds creepy to write a book to make money
<p>I joined a big tech company and it had a campus and if you had shoes you got stock options
<p>you don't want to be in the company that is the dot in the dotcom when there is a dotcom crash
<p>So we wrote a book about programming Java, whcih we knew about
<p>we were told we had to be in the top 2 or 3 books about Java
<p>fortunately lots of people are forced to learn java,so there is a chance
<p>we have to shrink the role of luck - we're not writing the great american novel
<p>I know you're supposed to stand here and say "don't do what I did", but do  - this works
<p>imagine a mixing board -look at what the competition is doing well and move the other sliders up
<p>how do we make a better X - don't tweak what's already good; improve the bits that are better
<p>we need people to say "I know Java; you should get this book"
<p>If everyone is chasing "how do I make this thing awesome" we focused on making the user more awesome
<p>nobody cares about what we make - we make tools. We care about what matters for the user
<p>what matters is what people are using it to do. What is their context?
<p>This is the Canon 5D - before we pay they use a brochure of photographs; after a black and white manual
<p>You're not a content creator, you're a context designer.
<p>what matters is the post-UX UX - can they do more? can they see things differently?
<p>nobody says "we want our users to suck", but how do we make thinsg bettre for them
<p>Play the game of "WTF Happened" - people want to be better when they get this thing. What stops them?
<p>WTF Happened?  - people get stuck early in the book
<p>we could compete on forward flow - getting people to keep going through the book
<p>we looked up research online and discussions - people think they have to remember something from a previous page
<p>or people are confused so they go back instead of forward
<p>no moving forward because of memory - don't require memory; 
<p>page vaporizer thought experiment: if you can't go back a page ever, what do you do? repeat things when needed
<p>Confusion is going to be a problem. But some things are hard. They stop because they don't know that it is hard.
<p>if you say "yes, this is confusing" they have permission to go on
<p>So many produts are awesome for people with nothing in their lives, but people are busy
<p>we know that users struggle with the rest of their lives; they are Users not Readers - they have use for it
<p>We make products for stock photo models, not real people
<p>when we don't honour their real lives we treat them like stock photo people or androids
<p>when we don't treat them like humans they wonder "am I even alive?"
<p>help them feel more like a living human.
<p>Should products feel alive? search for "my computer is trying" on google - we anthropomorphise everything
<p>The Media Equation took things we did with humans and tried them with computers
<p>people pay more attention to conversational language - you feel you have to keep up your end of it
<p>our users are all on their hero's journey. Who are we on their journey? Mentors? Allies? Sidekicks
<p>As <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/mallelis">@mallelis</a> pointed out, we're all going to die. -our computers ARE trying to kill us
<p>stand uop and say to another person "you are the badass" and respond "no you're the badass"
<p>You are all so badass. [no, you are cathy]
<p>You may know about this post I wrote "why the trolls will always win"
<p>I wrote to <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/ericmeyer">@ericmeyer</a> and I thought there was one thing that gave me hope in the community - the #RebeccaPurple
<p>and haveing sat through 2 days here with you all you all give me hope too, so there are now 2 things
