<p>most of the art that I make comes after I have felt anxiety and negative emotions
<p>I was annoyed by myself procrastinating thought "just fucking d oit already" and then wondered why nike owned a phrase
<p>I made a ton of new slogans for companies and tweeted them at them. like Subway: food optionâ„¢
<p>It doesn't matter if you feel bad when you're working
<p>I briefly mentioned agoraphobia earlier, and I keep making up reasons not to go outside
<p>I got commissioned to do some articles for a magazine so I used it to make myself go outside
<p>when I was a kid I used to crawl around and pretend I was a horse. I have always wished I was a horse
<p>quotes from school essay when she was 9 "I want to be famous for drawing horses one day"
<p>I love westerns but they are so racist and misogynist, and they don't even acknowledge the horses. 
<p>I wanted a surreal horse-focused western with dog people in it, and couldn't find one, so I made it
<p>a friend of mine pitched a TV show about a depressed horse man, and included my drawings, and it got picked up
<p>so I got to art direct it and painted watercolours of the characters
<p>I went to LA to art direct Bojack and it was terrifying, as I had no animation experience but had to work with a team
<p>what I love about working on the show is that it seems like a wacky sitcom at first but it comes from a personal place

<p>when I was a kid I dreamed I'd become a bubblegum dealer, like the Walter White of bubblegum
<p>when I was 10 we moved to Vancouver. To make my parents proud I thought I'd be a doctor and lawyer and sue myself
<p>I did not make my parents proud. I came out as gay to them and I had to leave home. I moved to san francisco
<p>I thought I'd be an independent game developer, but there is alot of anxiety there
<p>life is series of branching possibilities and if you take the wrong path the whole thing could go wrong.
<p>today I'm going to butcher chaos theory to explain how my life is unpredictable
<p>halfway through 2014 I was working on my independent game, and it had money rasied and so on
<p>I made a small side project to show how lighting worked in my game, and then went back to the same game
<p>but then for a game jam I made the "coming out simulator" that built on my experience coming out to my parents
<p>I made a branching narrative, but I didn't want to make too many branches, so I made some choices have subtle effects
<p>I published that and ti dis really well - got half a million plays and was helping very many people
<p>I got letters from people all over the world saying "coming out simulator" had helped them
<p>before I made it I only knew one version of the story, but for the game I had to see what other possibilities existed
<p>remember that interactive explainer I told you about a few minutes ago? good times
<p>the explainer got some publicity and I ended up making parable of the polygons with vi hart  <a class="auto-link" href="http://ncase.me/polygons/">http://ncase.me/polygons/</a>
<p>parable of the polygons did well, so I ended up making more of these
<p>I'm doing one on social media - who'd have thought that social media that exposes people leaves them feeling exposed
<p>related to systems theory is chaos theory, and you can think of evolution as properly harnessed chaos
<p>I finally killed the game project and I refunded everybody and gave a long explanation of why
<p>surprisingly they were really supportive, Who knew that killing your dreams could be such fun?
<p>I wasn't unproductive, but I was anxious. but then I learned about chaos theory from wikipedia
<p>so now instead of getting rid of Chaos, we should learn to live with it
<p>kill your dreams. Actually, serial kill your dreams, Up close they don't look good
<p>so experiment, improvise, and adapt to present chaos
<p>I had not been in contact with my family for a year, but I felt well enough to reach out and see them again
<p>we hung out at the Portland art museum and saw Kinsuge the japanese art of mending what you fucked up and broke
<p>You don't hide the scar, you highlight it with gold, to show you repaired it
<p>damage is a part of you, and you can make something from the broken pieces
<p>I'm not glamourising trauma and saying "to be a true artiste you have to suffer for your art"
<p>I'm saying that you can't go back but there are lots of ways to go forward
<p>There is no way to go back, but every way to go forward

That's not a joke - last year I applied and got denied.
<p>I tweeted that I was coming to XOXO, and was told that my kind was not supposed to be here. but I came anyway
<p>I'm not really supposed to be here as a VC either - I'm not an MBA from stanford but an mormon from SLC
<p>Andy told me that he didn't like the name <a class="auto-link" href="http://indie.vc">indie.vc</a> - that sin't supposed to fit
<p>we can't talk about venture capital without talking about unicorns
<p>the VC theory was that there were 6 companies a year that mattered - the ones that make $100M revenue or $1B value
<p>without one of those you'd never make back your fund
<p>Aileen Lee did the work to see how this really works, and found it was 4 a year and 99.93% of VCs companies failed
<p>in effect as a VC I have a product that doesn't work for 99.93% of my csutomers
<p>we create the Entrepreneurial Industrial Complex that defines what a unicorn founder is supposed to look like
<p>we now have entrepreneurs that are building companies, interacting with their users, solely to appeal to VC
<p>A while back we started OATV with Tim O'Reilly and Marc Jacobson. We saw all the cost of starting a company going down
<p>what if we could fund people who normally wouldn't have access to this kind of funding?
<p>what if we could fund with smaller amounts of money the companies that VCs won't invest in
<p>when we were raising the fund we had a lot of conversations about Bill O'Reilly because they didn't know who we are
<p>the problem was that we were seed funding companies that had to go to VCs for next rounds, the VCs didn't want to follow on
<p>pour some out for Wesabe, Chumby, GetSatisfaction, PMOG
<p>we did invest in a bunch of things that worked too, but those companies had to look like and act like unicorns for VCs
<p>other people's money is an addictive substance
<p>one of our founders said "I never want to raise any more money" after we funded him. Now he has raised $200M 
<p>Now he has a board full of VCs and none of the people he started with still work there.
<p>In 2012 we were raising our 3rd fund and I was having a midlife crisis about my job. Did we do what we set out to do?
<p>the reality was no. our funds did well, people wanted to invest, and we were turning money away
<p>we told them we wanted to do an experiment. Are any of the things we thought at the beginning not true?
<p>What fi we surrounded our founders whe didn't focus on funding and valuation but revenue and customers? 
<p>what if we changed what the archetype of success looked like?
<p>what if instead of trying to force everyone into a billion dollar company or collateral damage, we focused on profitable
<p>the types of founders coming into entrepreneurship was changing, being more diverse
<p>there were also founders who had done the venture thing and wanted to try something else
<p>marc hedland eventully told me "just ship"
<p>January 1 of 2015 I sent a note to 5 people and asked them to pass it on, so we can find 8 people
<p>I sent it at 9am on January 1st. by midday it was everywhere, and we had hundreds apply
<p>the challenge is that when your product is giving people money, product market fit is hard to guage
<p>for $100,000 we don't take equity, unless you raise further VC. if you pay yourself > 150% of market it's a distribution
<p>if it's a distribution, we start off taking 80% and you get 20% then it moves to the other way round and capped at 5x 
<p>we made a declaration of independence that said the product shouldn't be killed when you're bought by yahoo
<p>the response from female entrepreneurs was overwhelming
<p>of the 9 companies 5 had female founders, and 2 of them were black women
<p>we're 9 months in, and the best way to show that this is a good idea is to show results
<p>the companies are building real things and growing revenue.
<p>one of the companies is called Storq - products for expectant mums and new parents
<p>the shade room is a startup that is a pace for black people to speak.
<p>the revenue of shade room is up more than anyone else in the group's now
<p>the biggest LP passed - we have support from other investors; we hope to get it closed by the end of october, come talk

<p>I came here and everyone asks you what you do - so this is about the curly enigma in front of you
<p>plays video <a class="auto-link" href="https://www.facebook.com/thisisinsider/videos/1471078686532858/">https://www.facebook.com/thisisinsider/videos/1471078686532858/</a> to introduce her
<p>I got stuck with SmoothieFreak as a name on YouTube because I made a bad choice and then din't ever change it
<p>I started making comedy videos in 2012; I made over 100 of them, but none of them went viral
<p>I know that I'm funny. I'm not showing off; you know when you are
<p>I realised I was doing youtube wrong because I was trying to be popular instead of be funny
<p>so I made that "your 1st black girlfriend" video after my white boyfriend flaked on me & it was the most popular
<p>if you're over he age of 17 and say you're a Youtuber it's like saying amateur porn star or cat viner
<p>YouTube is not a platform; it has a connotation. So I now call myself a comedian, not a youtuber
<p>when I'm on a standup roster they now look down at me too
<p>no-one is more self-made than when you film in a dark room and then spend all weekend pantsless editing it
<p>Comedy thinks Youtube isn't real, TV thinks the internet is a phase
<p>the time you spend trying to get people to respect you is when you don't have a chance of getting it
<p>When you define success you're more likely to achieve it.
<p>if you can't make something that you're proud of when it is only you and your mom commenting on it, don't do it
<p>no-one likes blogging any more. I don't care what you did today, just send me a text with some emoji in
<p>ask yourself: "Will anyone be into this in a year?" "does this appeal to me or is it just popular?"
<p>the metric for success can be anything 
<p>it's not how many people view it, it's the calibre of the people who share it and comment
<p>I'ma big fan of Oprah, and she said "follow your bliss" and people say "i followed it and I'm poor"
<p>what Oprah meant was "if what you're doing is should sucking, stop doing it"
<p>"Once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand." - Velveteen Rabbit
<p>the moment that things stopped mattering was the moment that everything started happening

Rami then spent 15 minutes teaching us Arabic words, what order they go in and how to read them.
<blockquote>
<p>Arabic is a cursive script, the letters are connected when they make a word

<p>I was recently called the doyenne of podcasting, and someone called me an internet old
<p>I keep getting questions about how to engage with other people online
<p>there is now so much more at stake online - we spend ages curating a persona online and it affects a lot
<p>this guy was applying for a job and accidentally sent a nude selfie to the HR manager
<p>the negative effects of these things show up when they are stripped from context
<p>some fraction of the internet just show me of a gif, which is from a blooper reel 
<p>I was wearing a Cthulu in glasses t-shirt, and I jiggled to make Cthulu swim
<p>this guy pasted a video entitled 'victoria belmont boobies ftw' and got 450,000 views for it
<p>then the gif got cropped out of it and lost all context. This is my internet cockroach
<p>every time I do anything online that gif of 7 years ago me follows me around 
<p><a class="auto-link" href="http://xkcd.com/386">xkcd.com/386</a> applies - I want so badly to give context to these aresholes
<p>probably all of you have something like this out there that could follow you around too
<p>we haven't found a way to emotionally process this invincible and perfect memory online
<p>my friend dawn said 'over time this won't matter because we all have those things from the past'
<p>when we have to make particularly quick decisions the ability to have empathy is dramatically reduced
<p>there's only oen way for me to not lose my temper over this every time, is to have empathy with them
<p>schools are staring to teach empathy, maybe that can work
<p>we give our computers names: Siri, Cortana, Alexaâ€¦ Jeeves. â€” I didn't want to leave Jeeves out
<p>ZoÃ« Quinn and I have come to the same conclusion from different directions
<p>we all make mistakes at some point of our lives; but we can opt out of the internet mob machine
<p>people like the ones in this room can make the tools to make us more mindful
<p>in the end a more mindful internet will be better for all of us</div>
