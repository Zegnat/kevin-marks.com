<p>most of the art that I make comes after I have felt anxiety and negative emotions
<p>I was annoyed by myself procrastinating thought "just fucking d oit already" and then wondered why nike owned a phrase
<p>I made a ton of new slogans for companies and tweeted them at them. like Subway: food optionâ„¢
<p>It doesn't matter if you feel bad when you're working
<p>I briefly mentioned agoraphobia earlier, and I keep making up reasons not to go outside
<p>I got commissioned to do some articles for a magazine so I used it to make myself go outside
<p>when I was a kid I used to crawl around and pretend I was a horse. I have always wished I was a horse
<p>quotes from school essay when she was 9 "I want to be famous for drawing horses one day"
<p>I love westerns but they are so racist and misogynist, and they don't even acknowledge the horses. 
<p>I wanted a surreal horse-focused western with dog people in it, and couldn't find one, so I made it
<p>a friend of mine pitched a TV show about a depressed horse man, and included my drawings, and it got picked up
<p>so I got to art direct it and painted watercolours of the characters
<p>I went to LA to art direct Bojack and it was terrifying, as I had no animation experience but had to work with a team
<p>what I love about working on the show is that it seems like a wacky sitcom at first but it comes from a personal place

<p>when I was a kid I dreamed I'd become a bubblegum dealer, like the Walter White of bubblegum
<p>when I was 10 we moved to Vancouver. To make my parents proud I thought I'd be a doctor and lawyer and sue myself
<p>I did not make my parents proud. I came out as gay to them and I had to leave home. I moved to san francisco
<p>I thought I'd be an independent game developer, but there is alot of anxiety there
<p>life is series of branching possibilities and if you take the wrong path the whole thing could go wrong.
<p>today I'm going to butcher chaos theory to explain how my life is unpredictable
<p>halfway through 2014 I was working on my independent game, and it had money rasied and so on
<p>I made a small side project to show how lighting worked in my game, and then went back to the same game
<p>but then for a game jam I made the "coming out simulator" that built on my experience coming out to my parents
<p>I made a branching narrative, but I didn't want to make too many branches, so I made some choices have subtle effects
<p>I published that and ti dis really well - got half a million plays and was helping very many people
<p>I got letters from people all over the world saying "coming out simulator" had helped them
<p>before I made it I only knew one version of the story, but for the game I had to see what other possibilities existed
<p>remember that interactive explainer I told you about a few minutes ago? good times
<p>the explainer got some publicity and I ended up making parable of the polygons with vi hart  <a class="auto-link" href="http://ncase.me/polygons/">http://ncase.me/polygons/</a>
<p>parable of the polygons did well, so I ended up making more of these
<p>I'm doing one on social media - who'd have thought that social media that exposes people leaves them feeling exposed
<p>related to systems theory is chaos theory, and you can think of evolution as properly harnessed chaos
<p>I finally killed the game project and I refunded everybody and gave a long explanation of why
<p>surprisingly they were really supportive, Who knew that killing your dreams could be such fun?
<p>I wasn't unproductive, but I was anxious. but then I learned about chaos theory from wikipedia
<p>so now instead of getting rid of Chaos, we should learn to live with it
<p>kill your dreams. Actually, serial kill your dreams, Up close they don't look good
<p>so experiment, improvise, and adapt to present chaos
<p>I had not been in contact with my family for a year, but I felt well enough to reach out and see them again
<p>we hung out at the Portland art museum and saw Kinsuge the japanese art of mending what you fucked up and broke
<p>You don't hide the scar, you highlight it with gold, to show you repaired it
<p>damage is a part of you, and you can make something from the broken pieces
<p>I'm not glamourising trauma and saying "to be a true artiste you have to suffer for your art"
<p>I'm saying that you can't go back but there are lots of ways to go forward
<p>There is no way to go back, but every way to go forward

That's not a joke - last year I applied and got denied.
<p>I tweeted that I was coming to XOXO, and was told that my kind was not supposed to be here. but I came anyway
<p>I'm not really supposed to be here as a VC either - I'm not an MBA from stanford but an mormon from SLC
<p>Andy told me that he didn't like the name <a class="auto-link" href="http://indie.vc">indie.vc</a> - that sin't supposed to fit
<p>we can't talk about venture capital without talking about unicorns
<p>the VC theory was that there were 6 companies a year that mattered - the ones that make $100M revenue or $1B value
<p>without one of those you'd never make back your fund
<p>Aileen Lee did the work to see how this really works, and found it was 4 a year and 99.93% of VCs companies failed
<p>in effect as a VC I have a product that doesn't work for 99.93% of my csutomers
<p>we create the Entrepreneurial Industrial Complex that defines what a unicorn founder is supposed to look like
<p>we now have entrepreneurs that are building companies, interacting with their users, solely to appeal to VC
<p>A while back we started OATV with Tim O'Reilly and Marc Jacobson. We saw all the cost of starting a company going down
<p>what if we could fund people who normally wouldn't have access to this kind of funding?
<p>what if we could fund with smaller amounts of money the companies that VCs won't invest in
<p>when we were raising the fund we had a lot of conversations about Bill O'Reilly because they didn't know who we are
<p>the problem was that we were seed funding companies that had to go to VCs for next rounds, the VCs didn't want to follow on
<p>pour some out for Wesabe, Chumby, GetSatisfaction, PMOG
<p>we did invest in a bunch of things that worked too, but those companies had to look like and act like unicorns for VCs
<p>other people's money is an addictive substance
<p>one of our founders said "I never want to raise any more money" after we funded him. Now he has raised $200M 
<p>Now he has a board full of VCs and none of the people he started with still work there.
<p>In 2012 we were raising our 3rd fund and I was having a midlife crisis about my job. Did we do what we set out to do?
<p>the reality was no. our funds did well, people wanted to invest, and we were turning money away
<p>we told them we wanted to do an experiment. Are any of the things we thought at the beginning not true?
<p>What fi we surrounded our founders whe didn't focus on funding and valuation but revenue and customers? 
<p>what if we changed what the archetype of success looked like?
<p>what if instead of trying to force everyone into a billion dollar company or collateral damage, we focused on profitable
<p>the types of founders coming into entrepreneurship was changing, being more diverse
<p>there were also founders who had done the venture thing and wanted to try something else
<p>marc hedland eventully told me "just ship"
<p>January 1 of 2015 I sent a note to 5 people and asked them to pass it on, so we can find 8 people
<p>I sent it at 9am on January 1st. by midday it was everywhere, and we had hundreds apply
<p>the challenge is that when your product is giving people money, product market fit is hard to guage
<p>for $100,000 we don't take equity, unless you raise further VC. if you pay yourself > 150% of market it's a distribution
<p>if it's a distribution, we start off taking 80% and you get 20% then it moves to the other way round and capped at 5x 
<p>we made a declaration of independence that said the product shouldn't be killed when you're bought by yahoo
<p>the response from female entrepreneurs was overwhelming
<p>of the 9 companies 5 had female founders, and 2 of them were black women
<p>we're 9 months in, and the best way to show that this is a good idea is to show results
<p>the companies are building real things and growing revenue.
<p>one of the companies is called Storq - products for expectant mums and new parents
<p>the shade room is a startup that is a pace for black people to speak.
<p>the revenue of shade room is up more than anyone else in the group's now
<p>the biggest LP passed - we have support from other investors; we hope to get it closed by the end of october, come talk
