<h2>Opening Circle</h2>

<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.windley.com'>Phil Windley</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>A couple of months ago at BYU <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/dsearls">@dsearls</a> gave an opening talk, and that set the tone for the unconference -that worked
<p>12 years ago Kim Cameron of Microsoft defined the 12 laws of identity - I asked him to talk and update these laws

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.identityblog.com'>kim cameron</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>It's intimidating to be here with so many people who are key to my understanding of identity
<p>The laws of identity weren't written by me but by a whole group of us <a class="auto-link" href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=352">https://www.identityblog.com/?p=352</a>
<p>the goal was to codify what I know by identityâ€”Doc had just introduced me to the web through blogging, so I used my blog
<p>at the time the world of identity was fragmented and talking on a blog helped have a conversation in public #indieweb
<p>The internet was built without an identity system which is like building a house without plumbing
<p>the internet was a patchwork quilt of identity one-offs - everyone went to their basement and hacked things up
<p>at the same time the criminalisation of the internet was a huge growth industry
<p>It was also clear that there wasn't a single identity panacea 
<p>we wanted to have identity for the whole internet, not just for a Facebook, a Google  a Microsoft
<p>So it had to be a metasystem, not a system; it had to incorporate previous systems
<p>So we talked about "claims" - as opposed to the previous model of "assertions" that applied to a domain
<p>the problem of determining what claims you believed was an important one
<p>You can't just say you'll accept what identity providers say, you have to have of model of belief
<p>All of the world works on claims now, which were baked into SAML and OpenID connect and so on
<p>a digital subject is a person or thing in the digital world that is being dealt with
<p>a digital identity is a set of claims made by one digital subject about itself or other digital subjects
<p>self asserted claims are important - that is the basis of sovereign identity
<p>I hate the past and ignore the present I live in the architectural conditional
<p>I started as a physicist, so I propose laws with the goal of testing them to see if they apply
<p>the 1st law we put forward was User control and consent - not drive by  actors in the sky but users
<p>2nd law was minimal disclosure for constrained use - not splattering your information everywhere for everything
<p>you just release what you need to do a transaction, not everything about you
<p>3rd principle was justifiable parties to a transaction - only include parties that need to be there
<p>4th principle: directed identity - don't use universal identifiers for a specific transaction
<p>5th law is pluralism of operators and technologies - interact via claims to bridge both
<p>6th law is Human Integration - be aware that humans are part of the system - people have protocols too; relate to them
<p>7th law is Consistent experience across contexts - if every site works differently the users won't know how to use it
<p>what I do on my website should not be connected to what I do professionally, or to my credit cards
<p>My sympathies with the armed forces who are forced to use their social security numbers as their service numbers
<p>combining information with a common key like a SSN violates lots of laws of identity at once
<p>the big mistake I made was not understanding the asymmetric power of the parties
<p>the user, the identity provider and the relying party (service provider) have different power dynamics
<p>we had an idea of identity cards to choose from so that they can use their personal or business identities
<p>Google has done a good job of making this model work for logging in
<p>The Relying parties were busy counting clicks, and they didn't want to add one to log in remotely
<p>I hadn't understood how much control the Relying Parties had over the expereince of the users
<p>the 2nd thing I didn't understand was the multiplicity of the sources of claims - not single identity providers
<p>the relying parties want lots of different claims from many different sources - user, location, own systems
<p>they may want claims from attribute verifiers; they may want to send claims out to other systems
<p>both identity providers and relying parties need relationship management - arbitrating claims between providers
<p>the relying party needs someone to manage their relationships; equally important is managing it for the individual user
<p>I mentioned the relying parties first because they have all the power, but we need to care about the user experience too
<p>the level of complexity brought about by criminalisation is too high, so we need specialists
<p>I expect there to be Personal Identity Managers to be run on behalf of users
<p>because of the need for specialisation there will be concentration of systems for relying parties and for users
<p>hopefully these systems will be content-free - not using their concntration to prevent innovation
<p>this concentration creates a huge danger
<p>decentralisation is a great counterforce to this
<p>I'm encouraged by blockchain as the operator is disposable  - you  don't have to take the word of some VP

<p>We really don't want to put identity on the blockchain
<p>bitcoin is a permissionless system - no-one can stop you mining or transacting
