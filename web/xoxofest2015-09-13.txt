#xoxofest @waxpancake: i spent most of my time at FIlm and Animation with Tiny Rick and the New Jared
#xoxofest @waxpancake: I kept popping into tabletop with some incredibly epic werewolf games with over 30 people
#xoxofest @andymcmillan: I was at Film and Animation all night, and seeing Everything Is A Remix remastered was wonderful
#xoxofest @waxpancake: As soon as Everything Is A Remix showed up on kickstarter I saw that you backed it 20 seconds later
#xoxofest @waxpancake: being able to interview Anita Sarkeesian on stage was a great honour
#xoxofest @andymcmillan: i want to try something real quick, if you'll indulge me. well, the whole weekend is about indulging me
#xoxofest @andymcmillan: [calls his parents on facetime] andy's mum: how dare youse be there without me I'm disgusted. 
#xoxofest @waxpancake: my mum's right there int he front row, should I have a five minute conversation with her too
#xoxofest @waxpancake: periscope, live streaming: don't - we could do it, but we want to give our speakers the chance to review video
#xoxofest @andymcmillan: the quotes from us on the side of the beer probably reduce the value of it. Some empty pleasantries 
#xoxofest @waxpancake: we have independent creators across all genres, and one VC. Bet you didn't expect that. Take that thought leaders
#xoxofest @andymcmillan: It's Heart Leaders now. We get emails.
#xoxofest @lisadraws: I'm the designer and producer of  TV show called Bojack Horseman and I'm a really bad artist
#xoxofest @lisadraws: most of the art that I make comes after I have felt anxiety and negative emotions
#xoxofest @lisadraws: I was annoyed by myself procrastinating thought "just fucking d oit already" and then wondered why nike owned a phrase
#xoxofest @lisadraws: I made a ton of new slogans for companies and tweeted them at them. like Subway: food optionâ„¢
#xoxofest @lisadraws: It doesn't matter if you feel bad when you're working
#xoxofest @lisadraws: I briefly mentioned agoraphobia earlier, and I keep making up reasons not to go outside
#xoxofest @lisadraws: I got commissioned to do some articles for a magazine so I used it to make myself go outside
#xoxofest @lisadraws: when I was a kid I used to crawl around and pretend I was a horse. I have always wished I was a horse
#xoxofest @lisadraws: quotes from school essay when she was 9 "I want to be famous for drawing horses one day"
#xoxofest @lisadraws: I love westerns but they are so racist and misogynist, and they don't even acknowledge the horses. 
#xoxofest @lisadraws: I wanted a surreal horse-focused western with dog people in it, and couldn't find one, so I made it
#xoxofest @lisadraws: a friend of mine pitched a TV show about a depressed horse man, and included my drawings, and it got picked up
#xoxofest @lisadraws: so I got to art direct it and painted watercolours of the characters
#xoxofest @lisadraws: I went to LA to art direct Bojack and it was terrifying, as I had no animation experience but had to work with a team
#xoxofest @lisadraws: what I love about working on the show is that it seems like a wacky sitcom at first but it comes from a personal place
#xoxofest @waxpancake: our next speaker is one of my new favourite voices in art and independent technology
#xoxofest @waxpancake: Nicky case is using code to explain and show the world
#xoxofest @ncasenmare: i was born in singapore - it's this south east asian island somewhere and bubblegum is illegal there
#xoxofest @ncasenmare: when I was a kid I dreamed I'd become a bubblegum dealer, like the Walter White of bubblegum
#xoxofest @ncasenmare: when I was 10 we moved to Vancouver. To make my parents proud I thought I'd be a doctor and lawyer and sue myself
#xoxofest @ncasenmare: I did not make my parents proud. I came out as gay to them and I had to leave home. I moved to san francisco
#xoxofest @ncasenmare: I thought I'd be an independent game developer, but there is alot of anxiety there
#xoxofest @ncasenmare: life is series of branching possibilities and if you take the wrong path the whole thing could go wrong.
#xoxofest @ncasenmare: today I'm going to butcher chaos theory to explain how my life is unpredictable
#xoxofest @ncasenmare: halfway through 2014 I was working on my independent game, and it had money rasied and so on
#xoxofest @ncasenmare: I made a small side project to show how lighting worked in my game, and then went back to the same game
#xoxofest @ncasenmare: but then for a game jam I made the "coming out simulator" that built on my experience coming out to my parents
#xoxofest @ncasenmare: I made a branching narrative, but I didn't want to make too many branches, so I made some choices have subtle effects
#xoxofest @ncasenmare: I published that and ti dis really well - got half a million plays and was helping very many people
#xoxofest @ncasenmare: I got letters from people all over the world saying "coming out simulator" had helped them
#xoxofest @ncasenmare: before I made it I only knew one version of the story, but for the game I had to see what other possibilities existed
#xoxofest @ncasenmare: remember that interactive explainer I told you about a few minutes ago? good times
#xoxofest @ncasenmare: the explainer got some publicity and I ended up making parable of the polygons with vi hart  http://ncase.me/polygons/
#xoxofest @ncasenmare: parable of the polygons did well, so I ended up making more of these
#xoxofest @ncasenmare: I'm doing one on social media - who'd have thought that social media that exposes people leaves them feeling exposed
#xoxofest @ncasenmare: related to systems theory is chaos theory, and you can think of evolution as properly harnessed chaos
#xoxofest @ncasenmare: I finally killed the game project and I refunded everybody and gave a long explanation of why
#xoxofest @ncasenmare: surprisingly they were really supportive, Who knew that killing your dreams could be such fun?
#xoxofest @ncasenmare: I wasn't unproductive, but I was anxious. but then I learned about chaos theory from wikipedia
#xoxofest @ncasenmare: so now instead of getting rid of Chaos, we should learn to live with it
#xoxofest @ncasenmare: kill your dreams. Actually, serial kill your dreams, Up close they don't look good
#xoxofest @ncasenmare: so experiment, improvise, and adapt to present chaos
#xoxofest @ncasenmare: I had not been in contact with my family for a year, but I felt well enough to reach out and see them again
#xoxofest @ncasenmare: we hung out at the Portland art museum and saw Kinsuge the japanese art of mending what you fucked up and broke
#xoxofest @ncasenmare: You don't hide the scar, you highlight it with gold, to show you repaired it
#xoxofest @ncasenmare: damage is a part of you, and you can make something from the broken pieces
#xoxofest @ncasenmare: I'm not glamourising trauma and saying "to be a true artiste you have to suffer for your art"
#xoxofest @ncasenmare: I'm saying that you can't go back but there are lots of ways to go forward
#xoxofest @ncasenmare: There is no way to go back, but every way to go forward
#xoxofest @waxpancake: when you take large amounts of capital that can really change the way your business works
#xoxofest @waxpancake: when you take money and don't get hockey stick growth, VCs hate it and call those companies zombies
#xoxofest @waxpancake: welcome Bryce Roberts
#xoxofest @bryce: I'm not really supposed to be here. That's not a joke - last year I applied and got denied.
#xoxofest @bryce: I tweeted that I was coming to XOXO, and was told that my kind was not supposed to be here. but I came anyway
#xoxofest @bryce: I'm not really supposed to be here as a VC either - I'm not an MBA from stanford but an mormon from SLC
#xoxofest @bryce: Andy told me that he didn't like the name indie.vc - that sin't supposed to fit
#xoxofest @bryce: we can't talk about venture capital without talking about unicorns
#xoxofest @bryce: the VC theory was that there were 6 companies a year that mattered - the ones that make $100M revenue or $1B value
#xoxofest @bryce: without one of those you'd never make back your fund
#xoxofest @bryce: Aileen Lee did the work to see how this really works, and found it was 4 a year and 99.93% of VCs companies failed
#xoxofest @bryce: in effect as a VC I have a product that doesn't work for 99.93% of my csutomers
#xoxofest @bryce: we create the Entrepreneurial Industrial Complex that defines what a unicorn founder is supposed to look like
#xoxofest @bryce: we now have entrepreneurs that are building companies, interacting with their users, solely to appeal to VC
#xoxofest @bryce: A while back we started OATV with Tim O'Reilly and Marc Jacobson. We saw all the cost of starting a company going down
#xoxofest @bryce: what if we could fund people who normally wouldn't have access to this kind of funding?
#xoxofest @bryce: what if we could fund with smaller amounts of money the companies that VCs won't invest in
#xoxofest @bryce: when we were raising the fund we had a lot of conversations about Bill O'Reilly because they didn't know who we are
#xoxofest @bryce: the problem was that we were seed funding companies that had to go to VCs for next rounds, the VCs didn't want to follow on
#xoxofest @bryce: pour some out for Wesabe, Chumby, GetSatisfaction, PMOG
#xoxofest @bryce: we did invest in a bunch of things that worked too, but those companies had to look like and act like unicorns for VCs
#xoxofest @bryce: other people's money is an addictive substance
#xoxofest @bryce: one of our founders said "I never want to raise any more money" after we funded him. Now he has raised $200M 
#xoxofest @bryce: Now he has a board full of VCs and none of the people he started with still work there.
#xoxofest @bryce: In 2012 we were raising our 3rd fund and I was having a midlife crisis about my job. Did we do what we set out to do?
#xoxofest @bryce: the reality was no. our funds did well, people wanted to invest, and we were turning money away
#xoxofest @bryce: we told them we wanted to do an experiment. Are any of the things we thought at the beginning not true?
#xoxofest @bryce: What fi we surrounded our founders whe didn't focus on funding and valuation but revenue and customers? 
#xoxofest @bryce: what if we changed what the archetype of success looked like?
#xoxofest @bryce: what if instead of trying to force everyone into a billion dollar company or collateral damage, we focused on profitable
#xoxofest @bryce: the types of founders coming into entrepreneurship was changing, being more diverse
#xoxofest @bryce: there were also founders who had done the venture thing and wanted to try something else
#xoxofest @bryce: marc hedland eventully told me "just ship"
#xoxofest @bryce: January 1 of 2015 I sent a note to 5 people and asked them to pass it on, so we can find 8 people
#xoxofest @bryce: I sent it at 9am on January 1st. by midday it was everywhere, and we had hundreds apply
#xoxofest @bryce: the challenge is that when your product is giving people money, product market fit is hard to guage
#xoxofest @bryce: for $100,000 we don't take equity, unless you raise further VC. if you pay yourself > 150% of market it's a distribution
#xoxofest @bryce: if it's a distribution, we start off taking 80% and you get 20% then it moves to the other way round and capped at 5x 
#xoxofest @bryce: we made a declaration of independence that said the product shouldn't be killed when you're bought by yahoo
#xoxofest @bryce: the response from female entrepreneurs was overwhelming
#xoxofest @bryce: of the 9 companied 5 had female founders, and 2 of them were black women
#xoxofest @bryce: we're 9 months in, and the best way to show that this is a good idea is to show results
#xoxofest @bryce: the companies are building real things and growing revenue.
#xoxofest @bryce: one of the companies is called Storq - products for expectant mums and new parents
#xoxofest @bryce: the shade room is a startup that is a pace for black people to speak.
#xoxofest @bryce: the revenue of shade room is up more than anyone else in the group's now
#xoxofest @bryce: the biggest LP passed - we have support from other investors; we hope to get it closed by the end of october, come talk
