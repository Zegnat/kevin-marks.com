#ModelViewCulture @katelosse: surveillance technologies have become palpableâ€”white men have become the watched, when they were the watchers
#ModelViewCulture @katelosse: true transparency in the tech industry would be about power across the board - who has it, who uses it
#ModelViewCulture @ameliagreenhall: @shanley and I are cofounders of Model View Culture
#ModelViewCulture @shanley: I've been in the tech community for the last 5 years, but never again. I'm excited to be in tech media
#ModelViewCulture @ameliagreenhall: Last year Bustle launched a media site for women with $6.5M. @shanley and I were furious
#ModelViewCulture @ameliagreenhall: When women can't get money form VC, why can men get $6,5M to write about women
#ModelViewCulture @shanley: Mainstream technology is funded by VC, and it is toxic. They cover women as special interest and linkbait
#ModelViewCulture @ameliagreenhall: Confeerneces are adopting codes of conduct @transhack @blackgirlscode and more are building community
#ModelViewCulture @shanley: we see a massive need and a massive market for a new kind of tech media for diversity in tech
#ModelViewCulture @shanley: if you look at one of these communities it looks pretty small, but when you add them up it is huge
#ModelViewCulture @ameliagreenhall: 56% of women leave the tech industry within 10 years, and we were reaching that point
#ModelViewCulture @shanley: a picture of the 300 pages of paperwork we did to get incorporated - being a startup isn't as glamourous
#ModelViewCulture @shanley: we had to make sure we couldn't have our home addresses looked up in the state registries
#ModelViewCulture @shanley: we had to make sure we couldn't be DoS'd by the hate groups
#ModelViewCulture @shanley: we paid our Authors a week late as our Bank spelled Feminist as Femenist
#ModelViewCulture @shanley: We tried to do interviews with mainstream media, and they wanted to know what our site did for white men
#ModelViewCulture @ameliagreenhall: despite it all, 2 weeks ago we launched our first issue, and it went really well
#ModelViewCulture @shanley: we spend a lot of time working with writers. We have mobile offices 
#ModelViewCulture @ameliagreenhall: what I like about DIY is that we get to cook lunch - we spend our money on authors
#ModelViewCulture @ameliagreenhall: we don't have fancier equipment than out laptops and we take public transportation
#ModelViewCulture @shanley: we don't think we can maintain our editorial independence if we take VC or mainstream ads
#ModelViewCulture @shanley: Another thing that is really important is that we pay our writers
#ModelViewCulture @shanley: if you're marginalised, people try to get you to write for exposure. We need more than that, bro.
#ModelViewCulture @ameliagreenhall: we're excited and dedicated to producing lots of print media - that you can leave on the table at work
#ModelViewCulture @shanley: We pay writers. Send us your ideas - we will have themed issues, but send us contributions
#ModelViewCulture @ameliagreenhall: If you have imposter syndrome, please contribute anyway
#ModelViewCulture @shanley: we will walk you through imposter syndrome, it's a speciality of ours
#ModelViewCulture @ameliagreenhall: our next issue is exploring all the making happening outside the tech world
#ModelViewCulture @ameliagreenhall: we have a microphone now, so Model View Cast is coming
#ModelViewCulture @shanley: we'd love to do an art exhibition of 'shit men say to me on the internet'
#ModelViewCulture @ameliagreenhall: there are unconfirmed reports that we are putting together a conference later this year
#ModelViewCulture @ameliagreenhall: our first print edition is going to layout tomorrow -15.000 words of not before published writing
#ModelViewCulture @ameliagreenhall: we're getting it printed at 1984 media in Oakland which is a woman-run printers
#ModelViewCulture @shanley: Buy it Buy it Buy it - modelviewculture.com/subscribe
#ModelViewCulture @ameliagreenhall: thank you all for coming out
#ModelViewCulture @shanley: and thank you to all our writers
#ModelViewCulture @fakerapper: I wrote the article on Mark Zuckerberg in MVC, and I work on TransHack
#ModelViewCulture @xMattieBrice: I'm at mattiebrice.com and write on games and inclusion
#ModelViewCulture @ashedryden: A lot of the ideas of my writing is based on the DRY principle - Don't Repeat Yourself
#ModelViewCulture @ashedryden: a lot of my writing comes form things that happen that I don't want to happen over and over again
#ModelViewCulture @fakerapper: I work in music, video and write form my lived experience in tech or queerness -it's about me
#ModelViewCulture @xMattieBrice: I do a lot of creative, fiction writing - being on twitter is the easiest idea fount ever
#ModelViewCulture @shanley: critique and cultural criticism can be emotionally charged - can you talk about the responses you get?
#ModelViewCulture @xMattieBrice: you have a blur between activists and those writing their lived experiences, and majority culture reacts
#ModelViewCulture @xMattieBrice: it's hard to get it write - when you do it goes viral, when you don't it goes viral against you
#ModelViewCulture @fakerapper: most of my writing has gone viral when I'm being oppressed; when I'm positive it's less well received
#ModelViewCulture @ashedryden: I've had so many people come to me at conferences that invest trust in me as someone who will listen
#ModelViewCulture @ashedryden: by being mad about things on the internet, people trust me. Which is not to say that you shouldn't
#ModelViewCulture @ashedryden: on the other side I've had rape threats, death threats, been denied jobs, hand my friends attacked 
#ModelViewCulture @ashedryden: it's so difficult because so many people wnt to be better, but are invested in not having to change
#ModelViewCulture @ashedryden: there is a very vocal minority of people who are scary. I'm actually shaking now remembering it
#ModelViewCulture @shanley: so many of may friends are being affected by internet threats every day
#ModelViewCulture @shanley: one fo the biggest problems we face is financial stability
#ModelViewCulture @shanley: gittip and patreon really inspired me - how do you fund your work?
#ModelViewCulture @fakerapper: when I founded transhack I did a crowdfunding campaign, but I wasn't know as legit in tech
#ModelViewCulture @fakerapper: it took months to raise $6000, and taught me a lot about who gets funded
#ModelViewCulture @fakerapper: people who look a certain way are supported, and it's not me
#ModelViewCulture @fakerapper: I also invest my own money into projects - thats a way to be a leader
#ModelViewCulture @xMattieBrice: I very recntly started to community funding as a writer
#ModelViewCulture @xMattieBrice: online writing is very hard to get a livable wage
#ModelViewCulture @xMattieBrice: to pay my rent I would need to write 30-40 1000 word articles a month - and that doesn't cover food
#ModelViewCulture @xMattieBrice: video games publishing is even worse- game journalism is shrinkning
#ModelViewCulture @xMattieBrice: I turned to crowdfunding - I use Patreon. It allows people who do have a following to make money by writing
#ModelViewCulture @xMattieBrice: you can't just go on there and get money, you have to already have a following
#ModelViewCulture @xMattieBrice: how do we have a collective of writers, when we are seen as lone wolves
#ModelViewCulture @xMattieBrice: we need a new way of collective funding
#ModelViewCulture @ashedryden: I make money two ways - a lot of people give me money on gittip, which gives money weekly
#ModelViewCulture @ashedryden: I'm the top earner on gittip at the moment - it pays for catfood and trips - travel expenses
#ModelViewCulture @ashedryden: I did an indiegogo to fund some other conference travel and got over $6000 from that
#ModelViewCulture @ashedryden: I am probably the most privileged here
#ModelViewCulture @shanley: I'm interested in gittip and other funding models like this - we can take gittip money for MVC
#ModelViewCulture @xMattieBrice: In games journalism there are 5 or 6 main publications; I've been told my writing is too feminist, risky
#ModelViewCulture @xMattieBrice: it's hard to exist in a system that sees you as risky and weird. Games magazines are funded by men
#ModelViewCulture @xMattieBrice: I've had publications like The Guardian that did not cite me reliably for my writing
#ModelViewCulture @xMattieBrice: games journalism is already an iche; adding social justice makes it a nice of a niche
#ModelViewCulture @ashedryden: I haven't done any writing for mainstream things, but a lot of journalists follow me and take our ideas
#ModelViewCulture @ashedryden: this validates our ideas, but it doesn't give you control of your ideas
#ModelViewCulture @shanley: the day we launched every editor of a mainstream outlet followed us but only 1 wrote about us. Damn you.
#ModelViewCulture @fakerapper: to have our own platforms we need to be funded by the community -it doesn't work in tech
#ModelViewCulture @xMattieBrice: write now in Games Social Justice, dealing with anger is a big problem - people burn out
#ModelViewCulture @xMattieBrice: when you are asked over and over again by ignirant people about rape culture, you do burn out
#ModelViewCulture @xMattieBrice: people only want to talk to us when we eviscerate someone online - it becomes a blood sport
#ModelViewCulture @xMattieBrice: I could really use people who want to talk more about healing
#ModelViewCulture @ashedryden: a lot of people ask me about self care, but I'm really terrible at it. I have cats, they help
#ModelViewCulture @ashedryden: pulling yourself out of the situation is hard
#ModelViewCulture @ashedryden: the hardest thing is when I am upset about something, and no-one else is upset about it too
#ModelViewCulture @ashedryden: having other people who understand about why I am angry, without having to tell them
#ModelViewCulture @ashedryden: I get a lot of people who dm me on twitter saaing "I can't talk about this but someone has to"
#ModelViewCulture @fakerapper: As I get older, I am finally starting to figure out that I need people in my life who hold me up
#ModelViewCulture @fakerapper: My form of self care is growing my community of friends and people who love me
#ModelViewCulture @shanley: how can people support you?
#ModelViewCulture @fakerapper: transhack.org needs funding and support, and funding. help us
#ModelViewCulture @xMattieBrice: there is a thing called 'support games criticism' - find them and help support us and promote us
#ModelViewCulture @ashedryden: my website is ashedryden.com The best thing is having conversations you don't have to have and gittip
#ModelViewCulture @linguabee: we're sponsoring sign language interpretation tonight
#ModelViewCulture @linguabee: I remember being interviewed with an interpreter who couldn't understand me, and had to use body language
#ModelViewCulture @linguabee: that experience taught me a lot. Many deaf people go through this very single day
#ModelViewCulture @linguabee: I'm sure you've heard about the Mandela fake deaf interpreter
#ModelViewCulture @linguabee: would it make sense that your communication needs would be brought by someone you don't know
#ModelViewCulture @linguabee: a lot of interpretation agencies are run by hearing people, not by deaf people
#ModelViewCulture @linguabee: with Linguabee we have an agency where the deaf people have access to all the information on the platform
#ModelViewCulture @linguabee: diversity is first and foremost, and people who have the same experience can link up to help
#ModelViewCulture @lizhenry: I work now for Mozilla as a dev person, and I founded DoubleUnion, a feminist hacker/maker space
#ModelViewCulture @JDSulcer: I founded the level playing field institute that works to bring students of color into STEM
#ModelViewCulture @JDSulcer: we have a bridge between students aspirations and college - they don't have access to AP classes so we bridge
#ModelViewCulture @JDSulcer: we also run innovative computer science programs and hackathons
#ModelViewCulture @JDSulcer: think of a student in East Oakland who built an app to help them walk home from school safely
#ModelViewCulture @JDSulcer: I was an engineer for Hp and Agilent, now I run a non-profit in Oakland
#ModelViewCulture @ingridavendano: I worked with @hackbright to be part of tech companies and hackathons
#ModelViewCulture @ameliagreenhall: what are the big successes we're having in social justice?
#ModelViewCulture @ingridavendano: getting women and minorities into tech is hard-  I recently dropped out of school 
#ModelViewCulture @ingridavendano: I didn't even realise that I didn't have connections - there was such a barrier
#ModelViewCulture @ingridavendano: now there are so many oppportunities for companies to partner with these institutions
#ModelViewCulture @JDSulcer: there are a lot of STEM focused programs - we want students to use tech to solve problem in their community
#ModelViewCulture @JDSulcer: for example, to get students thinking about diet and food in their own community and what is available
#ModelViewCulture @JDSulcer: rather than just being consumers of technology, but creating tech too
#ModelViewCulture @JDSulcer: we have 56% of our students getting into college, compared to 23% overall
#ModelViewCulture @JDSulcer: don't just think about the big tech companies, but think how you can influence your local community with tech
#ModelViewCulture @lizhenry: there are a lot of different pathways people can take, and I want people to start new projects
#ModelViewCulture @lizhenry: people have to be inspired to connect with something for them and their community
#ModelViewCulture @lizhenry: whatever you start, people will want to use it for something else - to recruit or steer you
#ModelViewCulture @lizhenry: with DoubleUnion we wanted to serve the community of adult women who are inventors and makers
#ModelViewCulture @ameliagreenhall: what surprised you most about your organisation growing?
#ModelViewCulture @JDSulcer: one thing to think about when you start a new company is how you think about sustainability form the beginning
#ModelViewCulture @JDSulcer: the non-profit sector is about relationships in a mutually beneficial way
#ModelViewCulture @lizhenry: the speed that we grew surprised me, and the amount of community support that meant we had hit a nerve
#ModelViewCulture @lizhenry: the speed that we grew surprised me, and the amount of community support meant we had hit a nerve
#ModelViewCulture @lizhenry: use the strengths you have to help things happen
#ModelViewCulture @lizhenry: information infrastructure matters - we learnt from open source communities about how that works
#ModelViewCulture @ingridavendano:  I joined code2040 I had a great internship, but I couldn't go back to school as I lost my scholarship
#ModelViewCulture @ingridavendano: i earned too much money on my internship and lost the $16000 I had to support my education
#ModelViewCulture @ingridavendano: hackbright became an opportunity that opened up for me to get a job out here
#ModelViewCulture @ingridavendano: I never thought I'd have the opportunities I have today - 
#ModelViewCulture @ingridavendano: mentors that believed I could hold a job out here made all the difference
#ModelViewCulture @ingridavendano: a lot of my peers had parents who were ngineers who taught them what to expect. I didn't have that
#ModelViewCulture @ingridavendano: I had no idea what I was getting myself into - that there were no women in tech
#ModelViewCulture @ingridavendano: my first computer science class was really miserable, but I built something at the end of it
#ModelViewCulture @JDSulcer: we have teenagers who are away from home on campuses in a dorm for 5 weeks together
#ModelViewCulture @JDSulcer: safety is number 1 for them to learn and fail comfortably
#ModelViewCulture @JDSulcer: they're used to getting the answers at the back of the book -it's OK if you find another way
#ModelViewCulture @JDSulcer: students come with different beliefs and values- they learn not to ridicule each other
#ModelViewCulture @JDSulcer: the stickiness of the program is the community these young people build
#ModelViewCulture @lizhenry: it is really important in starting an organisation that you communicate expectations
#ModelViewCulture @lizhenry: and once you have established the values you have to keep to them, and kick people out to enforce
#ModelViewCulture @lizhenry: having a safe space for women shouldn't be revolutionary, but it is
#ModelViewCulture @ingridavendano: lots of women and minorities get shorted when negotiating salaries you need peers to talk to
#ModelViewCulture @ameliagreenhall: how can people support you?
#ModelViewCulture @JDSulcer: in kind tech services help a lot- build a website, volunteers and speakers, tours of companies
#ModelViewCulture @JDSulcer: there are students who live in Oakland who have never been to Berkeley, or East Palo Alto and Stanford
#ModelViewCulture @JDSulcer: and funding is also something we can use
#ModelViewCulture @ingridavendano: for both the programs that I went through, we need mentors who can translate students interests
#ModelViewCulture @ingridavendano: both hackbright and code2040 partener with companies - get involved with them
#ModelViewCulture @lizhenry: any kind of funding is great, but look for organisations doing work you respect and support them
#ModelViewCulture @lizhenry: don't got in and tell organisations how you want them to fix the world
#ModelViewCulture @lizhenry: asking and listening is good, don't tell them how to work
#ModelViewCulture @ameliagreenhall: Chris Dancy has a piece published in the next quarterly
that died in the 90s
#ModelViewCulture @ServiceSphere: in the 2000s we had a new closet on social networks like facebook - we had to come out again
#ModelViewCulture @ServiceSphere: most 20-30 year olds have never met anyone who has died from HIV
