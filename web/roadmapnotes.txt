#Roadmap2013 @jack: we don't just see it as payments, it's a continuum from what happens before to after. The receipt is part of that 
#Roadmap2013 @jack: offline commerce is still 90% of commerce - ecommerce is only about 10% so far. We still need to make that easier
#Roadmap2013 @jack: it's easy for companies to look at competition and react to that, but then you're on someone else's roadmap, not yours
#Roadmap2013 @jack: a lot of folks are building individual parts of payment, not connecting them together, so the merchant sees the seams
#Roadmap2013 @jack: Adding the Square reader to a phone gives it a superpower, do something new
#Roadmap2013 @jack: we learned a lot from sightglass - they still needed to take cash as well as cards, so we built a full PoS
#Roadmap2013 @jack: we can tell the merchant item level detail of what they sold when, not just prices. Like web analytics for retail
#Roadmap2013 @jack: we give access to all our information to every employee. Any meeting is required to take notes, get sent to all company
#Roadmap2013 @jack: if you enable people by sharing what is happening in meetings, they don't feel that they need to be invited
#Roadmap2013 @jack: we send the board meeting deck out to the entire company, 600 people have a copy of that
#Roadmap2013 @jack: if we do this right, we can create company that regenerates, that outlives any of our times there
#Roadmap2013 @jack: it's very hard to keep secrets - we built the structure of our office around this too - few conf rooms, lots of space
#Roadmap2013 @om: how do we make sure the rest of the tech industry think about how we make technology invisible?
#Roadmap2013 @jack: the tool that has helped most has been visualising what we want to see in the world and then building up to it
#Roadmap2013 @jack: it's not about technology disappearing, it's about the way we want the world to work
#Roadmap2013 @jack: it's about breaking something big into very simple problems that we can solve in sequence while seeing the big vision
#Roadmap2013 @om: having patience is ok with your kind of profile and backing, but lots of startups are under pressure
#Roadmap2013 @jack: people said "your previous experience was in microblogging what you had for breakfast -how can you move money around?"
#Roadmap2013 @zzleila: I want to understand how robots can live in our world rather than forcing us to live in a robotic world
#Roadmap2013 @zzleila: we built a robot that is almost human-sized, and moves around picking things up and moving them
#Roadmap2013 @zzleila: to build a robot you need mechanical engineers and programmers, but once people get involved we need sociologists too
#Roadmap2013 @zzleila: our robots can move around collecting empty coffee cups, folding towels, but they need to think very hard first
#Roadmap2013 @zzleila: we got a Pixar animator to help our robots to show emotional feedback to humans, if they're thinking or failing
#Roadmap2013 @zzleila: we need to set expectations for humans around the robots, so they'll catch an expensive robot if it falls off a table
#Roadmap2013 @zzleila: Henry Evans had a stroke, he's quadraplegic. He used our robot teleoperated to scratch his own face and shave himself
#Roadmap2013 @zzleila: our remote coworker Dallas used to be a voice in a plastic box, until we put a camera on a robot for him
#Roadmap2013 @zzleila: A lot of the people using our robots at the moment are universities - they're like mainframes now. We need startups
