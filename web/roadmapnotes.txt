#Roadmap2013 @jack: we don't just see it as payments, it's a continuum from what happens before to after. The receipt is part of that 
#Roadmap2013 @jack: offline commerce is still 90% of commerce - ecommerce is only about 10% so far. We still need to make that easier
#Roadmap2013 @jack: it's easy for companies to look at competition and react to that, but then you're on someone else's roadmap, not yours
#Roadmap2013 @jack: a lot of folks are building individual parts of payment, not connecting them together, so the merchant sees the seams
#Roadmap2013 @jack: Adding the Square reader to a phone gives it a superpower, do something new
#Roadmap2013 @jack: we learned a lot from sightglass - they still needed to take cash as well as cards, so we built a full PoS
#Roadmap2013 @jack: we can tell the merchant item level detail of what they sold when, not just prices. Like web analytics for retail
#Roadmap2013 @jack: we give access to all our information to every employee. Any meeting is required to take notes, get sent to all company
#Roadmap2013 @jack: if you enable people by sharing what is happening in meetings, they don't feel that they need to be invited
#Roadmap2013 @jack: we send the board meeting deck out to the entire company, 600 people have a copy of that
#Roadmap2013 @jack: if we do this right, we can create company that regenerates, that outlives any of our times there
#Roadmap2013 @jack: it's very hard to keep secrets - we built the structure of our office around this too - few conf rooms, lots of space
#Roadmap2013 @om: how do we make sure the rest of the tech industry think about how we make technology invisible?
#Roadmap2013 @jack: the tool that has helped most has been visualising what we want to see in the world and then building up to it
#Roadmap2013 @jack: it's not about technology disappearing, it's about the way we want the world to work
#Roadmap2013 @jack: it's about breaking something big into very simple problems that we can solve in sequence while seeing the big vision
#Roadmap2013 @om: having patience is ok with your kind of profile and backing, but lots of startups are under pressure
#Roadmap2013 @jack: people said "your previous experience was in microblogging what you had for breakfast -how can you move money around?"
#Roadmap2013 @zzleila: I want to understand how robots can live in our world rather than forcing us to live in a robotic world
#Roadmap2013 @zzleila: we built a robot that is almost human-sized, and moves around picking things up and moving them
#Roadmap2013 @zzleila: to build a robot you need mechanical engineers and programmers, but once people get involved we need sociologists too
#Roadmap2013 @zzleila: our robots can move around collecting empty coffee cups, folding towels, but they need to think very hard first
#Roadmap2013 @zzleila: we got a Pixar animator to help our robots to show emotional feedback to humans, if they're thinking or failing
#Roadmap2013 @zzleila: we need to set expectations for humans around the robots, so they'll catch an expensive robot if it falls off a table
#Roadmap2013 @zzleila: Henry Evans had a stroke, he's quadraplegic. He used our robot teleoperated to scratch his own face and shave himself
#Roadmap2013 @zzleila: our remote coworker Dallas used to be a voice in a plastic box, until we put a camera on a robot for him
#Roadmap2013 @zzleila: A lot of the people using our robots at the moment are universities - they're like mainframes now. We need startups
#Roadmap2013 @espiekermann: it might be arrogant to presume that people have seen what I do - some typeface Meta Sans, Economist Newtype
#Roadmap2013 @espiekermann: I used to draw by hand with pen and ink - there were only 126 characters to a font then, not 600 like now
#Roadmap2013 @espiekermann: Now there's drawing on screen which I'm lousy at , whcih si why I hire young designers who can do that for me
#Roadmap2013 @veen: in 2009 we were finally able to do good type on the web- you were quick to embrace it with your huge collection
#Roadmap2013 @espiekermann: for me it was very obvious - you don't have to be a fan of the screen to see people reading onscreen
#Roadmap2013 @espiekermann: It was obvious that it had to move in 2009 - Georgia+Helvetica are nice, but it's like eating dry bread + water
#Roadmap2013 @veen: I remember making the pitch to VCs as type being ripe for disruption "people pay for the shapes of letters?"
#Roadmap2013 @espiekermann: I'd rather have the 10% of people who pay rather than 100% of the people who don't pay
#Roadmap2013 @espiekermann: There is a human need to compose music, write books and to design typefaces
#Roadmap2013 @veen: a lot of people don't see the nuances in the expressiveness of type. Why is that?
#Roadmap2013 @espiekermann: You're not supposed to think about type - it's like water or air - if you notice it it's wrong
#Roadmap2013 @espiekermann: why are there thousands of vineyards when you have white and red? Type is in the few percent improvement
#Roadmap2013 @espiekermann: Whatever my shirt is in RGB I don't know, I'm an old print gut - it's 80% Cyan in CMYK
#Roadmap2013 @veen: Erik, you said the typography in iOS7 is the folly of youth
#Roadmap2013 @espiekermann: In Clarkenwell everyone has discovered Helvetica like you discovered salt
#Roadmap2013 @espiekermann: Everyone found you can reduce helvetica by 2 pixels. It's a beautiful typeface but it sucks for an interface
#Roadmap2013 @espiekermann: whan you're a user interface designer you have to forget your vanity and think about the user
#Roadmap2013 @espiekermann: when you're young you want to make a splash so you use a typeface to stand out, rather than for use
#Roadmap2013 @espiekermann: what we do in typefaces is design the 5% - 95% is a given set of rules for what letter shapes look like
#Roadmap2013 @espiekermann: it's almost like music - you have 8 notes in music - we design the sound of a word played with strings or brass
#Roadmap2013 @espiekermann: if you're showing the world what a great designer you are, it will probably become illegible or get annoying
#Roadmap2013 @veen: I enjoyed meeting type designers - there aren't a lot of them in the world
#Roadmap2013 @espiekermann: FontLab has about 2000 licensees, so there are that many. Full time ones maybe 200. It's incredibly boring.
#Roadmap2013 @espiekermann: Making a typeface is tedious and incredibly boring - it takes a very long time to go from an idea to a typeface
#Roadmap2013 @espiekermann: I sketch it out and then I have all these minions who work on the processes - I'm an art director
#Roadmap2013 @veen: what we did with TypeKit was open up a much broader market with Wordpress Themes etc -very controversial
#Roadmap2013 @espiekermann: You don't buy a typeface, you buy a font - we have to adapt everything for print, screen and TV, which is worst
#Roadmap2013 @veen: a lot of people feel insecure abut choosing wine in a restaurant, it's the same with choosing typefaces
#Roadmap2013 @espiekermann: in my office we have 60 people, and I go round and everyone ends up using the same typefaces as each other
#Roadmap2013 @espiekermann: as you say, it's like spotify - you use what you've used before, and keep using more of it
#Roadmap2013 @espiekermann: you wouldn't use the same images for every project, why would you use the same typeface?
#Roadmap2013 @espiekermann: Does it need to be muscular or feminine? Does it need to work at small sizes and big? Cyrillic or Greek?
#Roadmap2013 @veen: its no secret in the design community that the second link in a search will be a bittorrent site for a typeface
#Roadmap2013 @espiekermann: I want everyone to have  typefaces, but if you've spent 100s of hours designing it, it would be nice to honoured
#Roadmap2013 @espiekermann: of course no-one asked me to spend hundreds of hours designing the typeface in the first place...
#Roadmap2013 @espiekermann: We're designing a typeface for Firefox that will be open sourced, and I'm in two minds
#Roadmap2013 @espiekermann: my worry is that people will take it and mess it up and then I may get blamed for it
#Roadmap2013 @espiekermann: If you write a pop song you can't sue people for singing it out of tune. Don't blame me for your design
#Roadmap2013 @espiekermann: what we do as designers is interpret - we are the interface, making it easier for people to make it work
#Roadmap2013 @espiekermann: computers and technology are complex. We don't make them simpler, we make them more complex for people
#Roadmap2013 @espiekermann: I'm getting paid to make things look good. Isn't that fantastic?
#Roadmap2013 @katiefehren: Tinder is a year-old mobile dating app. You swipe people you like, and if they do it too, it puts you in touch
#Roadmap2013 @seanrad: We have a lot of frustrations with making new relationships. There's a lack of efficiency in meeting new people 
#Roadmap2013 @seanrad: you're either a hunter out there being rejected, or your being pursued and feeling overexposed
#Roadmap2013 @seanrad: when your friend in high school tells you that your crush also has a crush on you, that's what Tinder does
#Roadmap2013 @seanrad: we got the information right originally - tapping and waiting felt slow. Swiping felt faster
#Roadmap2013 @katiefehren: you went to great lengths to make it more female friendly - not a sausage fest
#Roadmap2013 @seanrad: we talked to women, and found that the guys that approach them are the creeps, not the good guys
#Roadmap2013 @seanrad: we're putting control back in the hands of women to decide who to interact with
#Roadmap2013 @seanrad: we wanted to make sure we were solving a core human issue. So we tested on college students
#Roadmap2013 @seanrad: the context of how you use these tools is  learned behaviour - we needed our users to show each other that
#Roadmap2013 @seanrad: It worked on a college campus where everyone has that shared context; expanding beyond that was harder
#Roadmap2013 @seanrad: everyone always says that problems of success are fun to have, but they're still hard and not that fun really.
#Roadmap2013 @seanrad: it's very worrying when you have everything to lose - you have prototype code so you're hanging by a thread
#Roadmap2013 @seanrad: If you create this double-opt-in relationship you can add a lot of efficiency to marketplaces [he still means dating]
#Roadmap2013 @om: I'm bummed out that you're doing this smoke alarm now that I've quit smoking
#Roadmap2013 @om: you're designing things that have been left unloved for decades
#Roadmap2013 @om: would you do locks? there are lot of locks on kickstarter
#Roadmap2013 @tfadell: You have to have a smoke alarm and a thermostat; locks and sprinklers you don't have to have.
#Roadmap2013 @tfadell: you can buy one that just goes BEEP or you can have one that is well designed
#Roadmap2013 @om: How about a smoke alarm that plays Justin Bieber? Ringtones for smoke alarms!
#Roadmap2013 @om: you should redesign the garage door opener next - that the most broken product I have
#Roadmap2013 @tfadell: In hardware now there are a lot of blot together things now - you don't have to call motorola for a cpu
#Roadmap2013 @tfadell: you can learn with that open hardware model, but to build a true hardware product you do need a lot of money
#Roadmap2013 @tfadell: when you do something that si atoms based you need a lot of money and a lot of time before the first customer
#Roadmap2013 @tfadell: Kickstarter and indiegogo are kind of for making beta products - to go mass market takes a lot more
#Roadmap2013 @om: Apple started with great hardware and then layered software on top of it. What should you start with?
#Roadmap2013 @tfadell: you have to optimise all along the chain -you need to look at the cost of the device and include the service and apps
#Roadmap2013 @tfadell: I'm an old school guy - I need to know how I'm going to get to profitability sooner or later
#Roadmap2013 @om: a lot of these products don't seem fully network aware - not as part of the brain of the device
#Roadmap2013 @tfadell: It reminds me of web 1.0 - it was like digital versions of magazines or albums. Internet of things is now 1.0
#Roadmap2013 @tfadell: Refrigerators with tablets on is Internet of Things 1.0 - they don't rethink the experience from top to bottom
#Roadmap2013 @tfadell: just because it can be connected doesn't mean it should. It should be reinvented *with* connection
#Roadmap2013 @tfadell: You need the right balance of rational and emotional features - Kahneman's thinking fast and slow model fits
#Roadmap2013 @tfadell: we started to see all kinds of data coming though the thermostat, and realised we could save them money
#Roadmap2013 @tfadell: these products aren't like cellphones that last 18 months - we have to create moments over 10 years
#Roadmap2013 @tfadell: Instagram created magical moments by adding filters - everyone said 'wow!' = emotional impact
#Roadmap2013 @tfadell: in 1999 I started a company no-one wanted to hear about hardware. Now they want to give me money
#Roadmap2013 @tfadell: there are so many more opportunities to be entrepreneurs now, but do work with your heroes first if you can

#roadmap2013 @gogoDanae: We're now seeing project owners setting a low goal and a series of stretch goals and what they'll deliver for them
#roadmap2013 @gogoDanae: A small town in Australia didn't want a McDonalds by their preschool, so used indiegogo to raise funds to protest
#roadmap2013 @MladenBarbaric: the only reason you wouldn't use indiegogo is if you wanted to hide your project - you should show it
#roadmap2013 @gogoDanae: indiegogo was a place for people who couldn't get traditional finance; now its for those who don't want it
#roadmap2013 @gogoDanae: think of indiegogo as a way to build on lean startup principles by giving you insight about your product
#roadmap2013 @gogoDanae: VC can only give you a vote of confidence, they can't tell you where your market is. indiegogo can
#roadmap2013 @gogoDanae: I can see people taking a hybrid approach to finance with indiegogo showing proof for venture/angel funders
#roadmap2013 @gogoDanae: finance has always been a system where the power was in a few people's hands. Now it's in your customers hands
#roadmap2013 @anthonyfranco: 87% of people say they have bad feelings about a company if they have a bad experience on their website
#roadmap2013 @anthonyfranco: our industry is modern plumbing to most people
#roadmap2013 @anthonyfranco: our industry must abandon it's mission to mechanise people by defining them as users
#roadmap2013 @om: GE and design? do they even go together - you make engines fro trains and planes
#roadmap2013 @bethcomstock: Now GE is about what happens when 50 billion machines come online - the Industrial Internet
#roadmap2013 @bethcomstock: what happens when machines communicate with one another? Or with people?
#roadmap2013 @bethcomstock: The future is about design, software and taking all the data the machines generate and making it useful
#roadmap2013 @bethcomstock: you want a lot of information to happen in the background, without people being aware, and to be predictive
#roadmap2013 @bethcomstock: "More technology is better but when you want to use it it has to be simpler" applies to the Industrial Internet
#roadmap2013 @bethcomstock: there has to be a different font that says "this is a machine talking" versus "this is a human talking"
#roadmap2013 @om: you're describing the same ideology as Tony Farell and Jack did, but you're spread worldwide - how?
#roadmap2013 @bethcomstock: we have a project in rural Chengdu in China to bring our designers and engineers to see their hospital nurses
#roadmap2013 @bethcomstock: it was hard to get people to think digitally until they had iPads and smartphones in the workplace
#roadmap2013 @bethcomstock: the onus is on us to make our applications even simpler so we can cut through the noise that apps make
#roadmap2013 @bethcomstock: Maybe you could work at Zynga and then at GE om: that would be easy, just put a stand outside, they'll come
#roadmap2013 @bethcomstock: We don't say we're big and boring. We're big, with huge machines that are very sexy
#roadmap2013 @bethcomstock: there's a little boy inside all of us who wants to know how a train works 
#roadmap2013 @om: that should be your sell - come work for GE and you can drive our trains
#roadmap2013 @bethcomstock: it's not just trains, you could ride in our pilotless planes too
#roadmap2013 @bethcomstock: In many cases we have the business model figured out - we have customers who want your design and code
#roadmap2013 @bethcomstock: There is going to be more productivity - to change the kinds of jobs available
#roadmap2013 @bethcomstock: one of our areas is hospital operations management - adding sensors and robots to hospitals to ease nurses' work
#roadmap2013 @bethcomstock: sensors have been put in our technology over the last decade - customers need to track assets first
#roadmap2013 @bethcomstock: a good thing about being in many industries is that we see trends across engineering, healthcare, aerospace etc
#roadmap2013 @bethcomstock: We have a connected wall oven that you can pre-heat before you get home or check you turned it off
#roadmap2013 @bethcomstock: We have things with Quirky - a net connected power strip so you can turn anything on and off remotely

Day 2

#roadmap2013 Franz Von Holzhausen: The Tesla design team was originally in the back of a rocket factory, which felt appropriate
#roadmap2013 Franz Von Holzhausen: a big flat battery meant we could come up with a 'skateboard' design, without the lump of metal in front
#roadmap2013 Franz Von Holzhausen: everything on the Tesla S prototype made it into production, becasue we made sure it was buildable
#roadmap2013 Franz Von Holzhausen: there is the idea of a minivan that is seen as a car you buy because you're forced to
#roadmap2013 Franz Von Holzhausen: conventional sliding doors aren't great for getting into the second and third row of seats, hence the gull wing
#roadmap2013 Franz Von Holzhausen: conventional sliding doors aren't good for getting into the 2nd and 3rd row of seats, hence the gull wing
#roadmap2013 Franz Von Holzhausen: the 3rd gen Tesla will be on a brand new platform, not based on the Model S
#roadmap2013 Franz Von Holzhausen: with the range of the Model S, you don't have to find a plug everywhere you go
#roadmap2013 @btaylor: we launched Quip 3 months ago - it's a mobile-focused word processor. We started from scratch
#roadmap2013 @btaylor: our documents aren't on virtual 8.5" by 11" bits of paper like most word processors, but on collaboration
#roadmap2013 @btaylor: Quip is the first time I've ever sold a product in my life - everything else I've made has been as supported
#roadmap2013 @btaylor: 35% of people use Quip on mobile only; 48% use it on tablets
#roadmap2013 @btaylor: we only added printing a week before launch, because we realised people might want thnt
#roadmap2013 @btaylor: there is a depth to word processing that will take a while to catch up - very specific keyboard shortcuts
#roadmap2013 @btaylor: even our biggest fans gave us a big list of particularr ways they had learned to use Word
#roadmap2013 @btaylor: price hasn't been the focal point of our sales discussions, as the product will be part of the core use of business
#roadmap2013 @btaylor: we charge $12/month, which is small compared to most business expenses. They key is experience
#roadmap2013 @btaylor: there was an arc of happiness that people had on friendfeed - initially too few friends; then enough; then too many
#roadmap2013 @btaylor: we lost a lot of people at both ends of this curve - the too few updates and the too many
#roadmap2013 @btaylor: I really like seeing photos in my twitter stream. I like the restraint they have in keeping the 140 char limit
#roadmap2013 @btaylor: the challenge for twitter is will they retain the soul of the product - the terseness that is their main story
#roadmap2013 @om: facebook now feels rather laborious - dealing with the feed feels like doing work
#roadmap2013 @btaylor: social isn't the product, it's what you design a product around
#roadmap2013 @btaylor: facebook's product design challenge is that it has so many different modes of interaction- photo, video etc
#roadmap2013 @btaylor: a lot of design patterns are moving from the mobile/tablet UI to the desktop. As usage changes this is key
#roadmap2013 @btaylor: one of the humbling things going from friendfeed to facebook was how formally they handled kinds of interaction
#roadmap2013 @btaylor: how to break down product design into different communication channels is a good way to think about things
#roadmap2013 @btaylor: the first time someone adds you to a document it sends a push notification, so most communication happens in realtime
#roadmap2013 @btaylor: because people's phones are full-featured computers, and you can bring people in via a push notification in real time
#roadmap2013 @btaylor: I think notifications need to be kept as a high signal channel and people will do that by choosing apps
#roadmap2013 @btaylor: now that the norm in an office is that you have a phone, a tablet and a pc, how does that change design choices?
#roadmap2013 @ScottBelsey: the internet should be the greatest thing for creativity - wherever you are in the world you can reach everyone
#roadmap2013 @ScottBelsey: 15,000 designers entered a design contest for a $1500 dollar prize - that's 4 years of wasted effort
