<p><a class='h-card' href='http://goodonpaper.com'>Andy McMillan</a>:  <blockquote><p>I couldn't speak at all this morning because I was screaming at <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/pamplemoose">@pamplemoose</a> so much last night
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://waxy.org/'>Andy Baio</a>:  <blockquote><p>in one of the games I tried to express my love to one of the characters and accidentally farted instead

<a class='h-card' href='http://goodonpaper.com'>Andy McMillan</a>:  <blockquote><p>65% of you may not know this, but there are goats - welcome to Portland <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/belmontgoats">@belmontgoats</a>

<a class='h-card' href='http://www.kk.org/kk'>Kevin Kelly</a>:  <blockquote><p>when you're giving a presentation, they always tell you not to say more than 3 things. I'm going to tell you 30 things
<p>when i was young I found a book in the library called the Golden Book of Chemistry - it told me how to make Chlorine
<p>when I was in middle school I made a rip off of Dali's painting of melted clocks, but I had a working clock in mine
<p>When I travelled through asia it was like going back in time to the 15th century - in Kashmir, Srinagar - that has gone
<p>I had all these slides and there was no way to make a photo book then, but eventually I did <a class="auto-link" href="http://asiagrace.com/">http://asiagrace.com/</a>
<p>sometimes I make useful stuff like a bed, but I tend to make weird + useless things—a robot made from a year's packaging
<p>in the 60s we did things like making a geodesic dome in the desert, which is now a thing, apparently
<p>Stewart Brand self-published the Whole Earth Catalog, which was all user-submitted content - it was the web in print
<p>The Whole Earth Catalog took 30 people a year, Cool Tools I did with 2 of us
<p>I only needed 3 copies of Cool Tools, but it got to #15 on Amazon and sold 42,000 copies
<p>every new technology creates new ways to succeed - we will have more than mainstreet publishing and self publishing
<p>we have mayflies whose success is measured in days and bristlecone pines who measure it in 5000 years—different success
<p>there is a Cambrian explosion of technology, creating more possibilities
<p>The more possibilities, the more successes are unique.
<p>when everyone was a farmer, all successes looked very similar; now there are so many different twisty paths to success
<p>Paul Graham's definition of a startup is one that grows very fast: startups are like pigeons. We need birds of paradise
<p>The greatest failures are due to success. The Innovators Dilemma explains how new successes come from the outside 
<p>Startups are in the high risk domain because they have no choice - they don't have the money for the safe domains
<p>There's a trade-off between Optimization and Discovery; between Knowledge and Imagination; between Answers and Questions
<p>If you had 1000 true fans who buys everything you do, you could have a living - now people are doing this
<p>the next 10,000 startups will be AI in the cloud added to X, for lots of X
<p>Technology allows you to define your own success
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://waxy.org/'>Andy Baio</a>:  <blockquote><p>our next speaker started a product whose motto is "It's nice to be nice" because <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/ginatrapani">@ginatrapani</a> is so very nice
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://ginatrapani.org'>Gina Trapani</a>:  <blockquote><p>somebody told me I should open with a joke, but I'm opening with 9-11
<p>In 2001 I was working at a startup in lower manhattan, standing at spring street and hudson 
<p>A former coworker of mine had got a job at the World Trade Center, and he turned up shaking as his alarm hadn't gone off
<p>watching all those people die that day made me obsessed with time, and that it will run out on all of us
<p>every day a version of us dies, as each change makes a new version of us 
<p>I became obsessed with documenting every part of my life because it felt like it might disappear any day
<p>I felt like I might die doing something stupid like upgrading an operating system
<p>so I started Lifehacker in 2004 to optimise everything in life, from buttering your toast with a cheese slicer 
<p>the bit of the tagline that wasn't on Lifehacker was "optimise your life because you are going to die"
<p>Lifehacker was like XOXO - anti-snark, optimistic and it came from me being scared for my life
<p>Someday, somehow your worst moments are going to feed your best work
<p>Michael Barish says every relationship goes through a Good Thing, a Rut, and a Transition
<p>A rut isn't abad thing, it's comfortable and familiar. Ruts are sticky, it's hard to pull yourself out of them
<p>Even if you have a dream job like I did, you start to coast. I spent so much time saving time I had no time for myself
<p>
<p>
<p>my mother always says "a lady knows when it is time to leave the dance"
<p>You have to drift for a while and maybe you take some weird detours - I wrote a book about Google Wave
<p>I'm still obsessed with time, not so much losing time and wasting time, but making the time I spend worthwhile
<p>Louis CK says we have all volunteered for data entry jobs for facebook and twitter [ummm…]
<p>getting married and having a baby were moments in my life made better by being on twitter with you
<p>the time we spend on social networks can be trivial or meaningful. Twitter+Facebook analyse our data, but we should too
<p>my site <a class="auto-link" href="http://thinkup.com">thinkup.com</a> tries its best to find the meaningful things that happen on social networks
<p>part of our job as makers is to tell the story of things we make

<a class='h-card' href='http://flong.com'>Golan Levin</a>:  <blockquote><p>most of my work is creating tools for others - I have been writing code to make art
<p>this is an 8 foot tall robot that is on top of an art museum that is a cross between 1984 and sesame street
<p>one of my projects is adaptors between all construction kits -lego, tinker toys, stickle bricks
<p>This is a metaphor for corporate silos - the work we have to do to make them interoperate #indieweb

<a class='h-card' href='http://www.pablogarcia.org'>Pablo Garcia</a>:  <blockquote><p>I'm trained as an architect, and have a long relationship with mechanical drawing machines
<p>I modified a CNC router to have pen and draw pictures of historic drawing machines
<p>I made a morphed skull illusion that shows up in reflective cylinders, and made 100s and left them around town
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://flong.com'>Golan Levin</a>:  <blockquote><p>we're both educators, and both interested in media technology and its history
<p>we have a lot of art students who think realistic drawing is great art - even though it is obsoleted by cameras
<p>David Hockney's book Secret Knowledge says that the old masters used optical tools like the camera lucida
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.pablogarcia.org'>Pablo Garcia</a>:  <blockquote><p>I bought vintage camera lucidas and started drawing things with them
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://flong.com'>Golan Levin</a>:  <blockquote><p>camera lucida's haven't been manufactured in 300 years so they are pricy on ebay. So we decided to make a new one
<p>a camera lucida is a prism on a stick. The stick is the easy part, but the prisms aren't made that size now
<p>we needed to make 500 prisms so we did kickstarter to find 500 people who wanted 1. We found 15,000
<p>a MOOC that pwned Kickstarter in order to reimagine commerce and education - we used updates to deliver art history lectures
<p>in this parallel universe, kickstarter backers are students and their pledges are tuition fees
<p>we also looked at kickstarter as a performance piece - product as provocation
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.pablogarcia.org'>Pablo Garcia</a>:  <blockquote><p>the 3rd way to think of this is the search for Dan Winkler, who has done a neolucida drawing every day for a year
<p>Dan Winckler is the peak of participation opposite the long tail - <a class="auto-link" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/danwinckler/">https://www.flickr.com/photos/danwinckler/</a>
<p>we asked china what gooseneck lengths they had lying around; they said they'd make them to order - China doesn't have shelves
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://flong.com'>Golan Levin</a>:  <blockquote><p>here are the 10 men and women who worked with us for 2 weeks to make the neolucidas - 12 hours a day, 2 weeks $1.50/hr
<p>one of our workers made 1000 neolucidas a day. I tried and could not keep up
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.pablogarcia.org'>Pablo Garcia</a>:  <blockquote><p>what we learned in China is that all of our stuff is hand-made, even if it looks lie it isn't
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://flong.com'>Golan Levin</a>:  <blockquote><p>every thing we have - every single thing - has handprints on it of the people who made it for us in China
