<p><a href="http://youtu.be/i1cmnizKPlk">Kevin Kelly's talk on Youtube</a>
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.kk.org/kk'>Kevin Kelly</a>:  <blockquote><p>when you're giving a presentation, they always tell you not to say more than 3 things. I'm going to tell you 30 things
<p>when i was young I found a book in the library called the Golden Book of Chemistry - it told me how to make Chlorine
<p>when I was in middle school I made a rip off of Dali's painting of melted clocks, but I had a working clock in mine
<p>When I travelled through asia it was like going back in time to the 15th century - in Kashmir, Srinagar - that has gone
<p>I had all these slides and there was no way to make a photo book then, but eventually I did <a class="auto-link" href="http://asiagrace.com/">http://asiagrace.com/</a>
<p>sometimes I make useful stuff like a bed, but I tend to make weird + useless things—a robot made from a year's packaging
<p>in the 60s we did things like making a geodesic dome in the desert, which is now a thing, apparently
<p>Stewart Brand self-published the Whole Earth Catalog, which was all user-submitted content - it was the web in print
<p>The Whole Earth Catalog took 30 people a year, Cool Tools I did with 2 of us
<p>I only needed 3 copies of Cool Tools, but it got to #15 on Amazon and sold 42,000 copies
<p>every new technology creates new ways to succeed - we will have more than mainstreet publishing and self publishing
<p>we have mayflies whose success is measured in days and bristlecone pines who measure it in 5000 years—different success
<p>there is a Cambrian explosion of technology, creating more possibilities
<p>The more possibilities, the more successes are unique.
<p>when everyone was a farmer, all successes looked very similar; now there are so many different twisty paths to success
<p>Paul Graham's definition of a startup is one that grows very fast: startups are like pigeons. We need birds of paradise
<p>The greatest failures are due to success. The Innovators Dilemma explains how new successes come from the outside 
<p>Startups are in the high risk domain because they have no choice - they don't have the money for the safe domains
<p>There's a trade-off between Optimization and Discovery; between Knowledge and Imagination; between Answers and Questions
<p>If you had 1000 true fans who buys everything you do, you could have a living - now people are doing this
<p>the next 10,000 startups will be AI in the cloud added to X, for lots of X
<p>Technology allows you to define your own success
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://waxy.org/'>Andy Baio</a>:  <blockquote><p>our next speaker started a product whose motto is "It's nice to be nice" because <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/ginatrapani">@ginatrapani</a> is so very nice
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://ginatrapani.org'>Gina Trapani</a>:  <blockquote><p>somebody told me I should open with a joke, but I'm opening with 9-11
<p>In 2001 I was working at a startup in lower manhattan, standing at spring street and hudson 
<p>A former coworker of mine had got a job at the World Trade Center, and he turned up shaking as his alarm hadn't gone off
<p>watching all those people die that day made me obsessed with time, and that it will run out on all of us
<p>every day a version of us dies, as each change makes a new version of us 
<p>I became obsessed with documenting every part of my life because it felt like it might disappear any day
<p>I felt like I might die doing something stupid like upgrading an operating system
<p>so I started Lifehacker in 2004 to optimise everything in life, from buttering your toast with a cheese slicer 
<p>the bit of the tagline that wasn't on Lifehacker was "optimise your life because you are going to die"
<p>Lifehacker was like XOXO - anti-snark, optimistic and it came from me being scared for my life
<p>Someday, somehow your worst moments are going to feed your best work
<p>Michael Barish says every relationship goes through a Good Thing, a Rut, and a Transition
<p>A rut isn't abad thing, it's comfortable and familiar. Ruts are sticky, it's hard to pull yourself out of them
<p>Even if you have a dream job like I did, you start to coast. I spent so much time saving time I had no time for myself
<p>my mother always says "a lady knows when it is time to leave the dance"
<p>You have to drift for a while and maybe you take some weird detours - I wrote a book about Google Wave
<p>I'm still obsessed with time, not so much losing time and wasting time, but making the time I spend worthwhile
<p>Louis CK says we have all volunteered for data entry jobs for facebook and twitter [ummm…]
<p>getting married and having a baby were moments in my life made better by being on twitter with you
<p>the time we spend on social networks can be trivial or meaningful. Twitter+Facebook analyse our data, but we should too
<p>my site <a class="auto-link" href="http://thinkup.com">thinkup.com</a> tries its best to find the meaningful things that happen on social networks
<p>part of our job as makers is to tell the story of things we make

<a class='h-card' href='http://flong.com'>Golan Levin</a>:  <blockquote><p>most of my work is creating tools for others - I have been writing code to make art
<p>this is an 8 foot tall robot that is on top of an art museum that is a cross between 1984 and sesame street
<p>one of my projects is adaptors between all construction kits -lego, tinker toys, stickle bricks
<p>This is a metaphor for corporate silos - the work we have to do to make them interoperate #indieweb
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.pablogarcia.org'>Pablo Garcia</a>:  <blockquote><p>I'm trained as an architect, and have a long relationship with mechanical drawing machines
<p>I modified a CNC router to have pen and draw pictures of historic drawing machines
<p>I made a morphed skull illusion that shows up in reflective cylinders, and made 100s and left them around town
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://flong.com'>Golan Levin</a>:  <blockquote><p>we're both educators, and both interested in media technology and its history
<p>we have a lot of art students who think realistic drawing is great art - even though it is obsoleted by cameras
<p>David Hockney's book Secret Knowledge says that the old masters used optical tools like the camera lucida
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.pablogarcia.org'>Pablo Garcia</a>:  <blockquote><p>I bought vintage camera lucidas and started drawing things with them
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://flong.com'>Golan Levin</a>:  <blockquote><p>camera lucida's haven't been manufactured in 300 years so they are pricy on ebay. So we decided to make a new one
<p>a camera lucida is a prism on a stick. The stick is the easy part, but the prisms aren't made that size now
<p>we needed to make 500 prisms so we did kickstarter to find 500 people who wanted 1. We found 15,000
<p>a MOOC that pwned Kickstarter in order to reimagine commerce and education - we used updates to deliver art history lectures
<p>in this parallel universe, kickstarter backers are students and their pledges are tuition fees
<p>we also looked at kickstarter as a performance piece - product as provocation
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.pablogarcia.org'>Pablo Garcia</a>:  <blockquote><p>the 3rd way to think of this is the search for Dan Winkler, who has done a neolucida drawing every day for a year
<p>Dan Winckler is the peak of participation opposite the long tail - <a class="auto-link" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/danwinckler/">https://www.flickr.com/photos/danwinckler/</a>
<p>we asked china what gooseneck lengths they had lying around; they said they'd make them to order - China doesn't have shelves
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://flong.com'>Golan Levin</a>:  <blockquote><p>here are the 10 men and women who worked with us for 2 weeks to make the neolucidas - 12 hours a day, 2 weeks $1.50/hr
<p>one of our workers made 1000 neolucidas a day. I tried and could not keep up
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.pablogarcia.org'>Pablo Garcia</a>:  <blockquote><p>what we learned in China is that all of our stuff is hand-made, even if it looks lie it isn't
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://flong.com'>Golan Levin</a>:  <blockquote><p>every thing we have - every single thing - has handprints on it of the people who made it for us in China
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.kk.org/kk'>Kevin Kelly</a>:  <blockquote><p>Kaia Dekker (<a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/quince">@quince</a>) wants moveable type for sandals so you can leave messages in your footprints
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://waxy.org/'>Andy Baio</a>:  <blockquote><p>Bandcamp is a way for independent musicians to sell their music directly
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://bandcamp.com'>bandcamp</a>:  <blockquote><p>we are a distributed company - we used to use irc for everything but now we switched to slack
<p>even though Sean and I sit in the same office, we talk to each other through Slack 
<p>I realised I can go for a week without talking to people, and now I'm talking to a thousand of you
<p>listening to a song 10000 times whil;e an ad sells you toothpaste isn't a way to support and artist
<p>paying subscriptions to a large company partly owned by other large companies doesn't tends to get much money to artists
<p>Fans have given $81 million to artists through bandcamp, $2.9M in the last 30 days
<p><a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/zoecello">@zoecello</a> published her earnings last yeat 92% came from sales and 8% from streaming
<p><a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/zoecello">@zoecello</a>'s sales were 34% through bandcamp, 15% Amazon and 51% iTunes last year
<p>back in 2007 there was a band I really liked and they left their label, and their site didn't load
<p>the band site din't work well and I had to get the music emailed to me by the lead singer
<p>The services in 2007 for musicians were essentially a sharecropping - you gave them your content and they owned it
<p>we raised a tiny amount of VC - stuck between the seat covers of the VC's Tesla kind of money
<p>we worked in the public library for the first 4 years of the startup
<p>we became profitable in 2012 - we were keen to be a sustainable business
<p>If I was hoping for musicians to sustain themselves from my service I needed to do that myself too
<p>Thom Yorke called subscription streaming the last sad fart of a dying corpse
<p>as user numbers go up for subscription streaming services, losses grow higher too
<p>shifting all our music consumption to subscription based streaming loses something important - the record collection
<p>I used to browse my friends CD collections and discover music from them
<p>Everyone having everything looks a lot like everyone having nothing
<p>your kids are never going to look through your summer 2014 playlist
<p>Streaming services can be good for discovery but the best way to support a musician is to directly give them money
<p>a collection of tracks that people spend money on is important
<p>there have been 11 million transactions on Bandcamp
<p>fans pay more than the artist's asking price 50% of the time, and have given up to 100x
<p>about half of the notes left for artists are saying they are sorry not to be able to give more
<p>I saw <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/dickc">@dickc</a> at a conference, described bandcamp to him and he backed away while I was talking and turned to someone else
<p>People want to support the artists they love, but they don't know what to do to do so

<a class='h-card' href='http://waxy.org/'>Andy Baio</a>:  <blockquote><p>Rachel Binx is a data visualiser from Brooklyn New york
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://rachelbinx.com'>rachel binx</a>:  <blockquote><p>thank you for having me at 'cho-cho' - I'm using the Basque X there
<p>My day job is data visualisation, but you may know me from meshyou - turning places into 3d dobjects
<p>we originally though of it as a data visualisation project - location traces from <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/foursquare">@foursquare</a>
<p>the other idea is gifpop - lenticular printing of animated gifs
<p>there is a lot of amazing work being done in the gif medium these days
<p>when you give to the internet, the internet gives back
<p>we like making physical things out of stuff on the internet
<p>normally at this point I'd show you a photo of me coding as a child, but that isn't true I learned to code 5 years ago
<p>I made earrings from bottle tops and tried to sell them as a hip local artist and made maybe $25
<p>I learned that earnestness isn't enough- you have to understand the business
<p>I took photos for a friend, and he cropped of the watermarks, put them up and never spoke again
<p>This happens too often. "Fuck you, pay me" isn't just a cute use of profanity, it matters.
<p>I went to Stamem and got to go to conferences and say "yes I do both design and code" (picture of unicorn)
<p>if you're like me, interests turn into fascinations and then into projects. My success is from a refusal to focus
<p>the projects are drawing connections between different interests so that you can show them to people
<p>I wrote a slide saying "Life pro tip: do everything all the time" - I'm getting into vague life advice 
<p>when it works its great to be a freelancer, but when it sucks it really sucks
<p>I had my first public failure last year - I tried to start a conference called ThingConf for small biz
<p>I thought "great, now I can write a medium post on failure"
<p>failing on the internet is like crying in public
<p>this is a screenshot of my net income in 2013 - it's nicely symmetric negative income

<a class='h-card' href='http://waxy.org/'>Andy Baio</a>:  <blockquote><p>our next speaker has recorded a song every day for over 2000 days so far - Jonathan Mann
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@songadaymann'>Jonathan Mann</a>:  <blockquote><p>my grandma and I were really close, and she passed away about a year ago.
<p>everyone else in my family is normal, but only my grandma is a weirdo like me
<p>my grandma got her masters in Psychology in 1946 and worked as a psychoanalyst in NY until 1966 when my grandpa died
<p>my grandma moved to Big Sur in 1966 and joined the Esalen Institute and became a hippie and travelled the world
<p>my grandma loved to dance - she would dance all the time; she danced at a classical music concert in an NY park
<p>Song a Day started with this thing called Fun A Day—make one piece of art for every day in January 2009. I didn't stop
<p>I have now written 2,082 songs, one a day. I realised that I felt good when I made something
<p>a lot of days my favourite songs come out when I feel have nothing, and then it appears
<p>lets visit some more of my viraly viral things
<p>song #77 I wrote about Paul Krugman - it was on Huffington Post and got to play it on Rachel Maddow
<p>I did a jingle for Bing and won $500. <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/parislemon">@parislemon</a> said it was terrible, so I made a song about him. 
<p>I wrote a song called "if you don't want an iPhone 4 don't buy it"
<p>Apple rang me up. I don't know how they got my number, but they are Apple…
<p>Steve Jobs walked out into the antennagate press conference to my song. 
<p>My ex and I posted a song about us breaking up, which went crazy viral 
<p>I wrote a song about needing a roommate
<p>I set Ruth Bader Ginsberg's dissent in the Hobby Lobby case to music
<p>some days there is a huge viral wave, but most days it's like a quiet day fishing - I catch a song, and put it back
<p>sometimes it feels like the gaping maw of the internet is there and I have to keep feeding it songs
<p>sometimes I'll post a song that's a whatever song to me, and someone says "this is just what I needed today"
<p>Day 355 I got food poisoning, and it was 3am and I hadn't made a song, so I got in the bath and sang
<p>
<p>I've contemplated stopping; my 2000th song was around the day my son was born, but I wrote another song
<p>on the day that my grandma died I wrote a song
<p>My grandma had her casket made about 10 years before she died and kept it on her lawn. She would lie in it.
<p>I had written grandma a song for her birthday every year, so I wrote another one when she was in the hospice

<a class='h-card' href='http://waxy.org/'>Andy Baio</a>:  <blockquote><p>Some of the content of this next talk is very disturbing. I've been trying to get Anita for 2 years
<p>Anita wades through so much abuse daily - there were even threats  to her for coming here
<p>
<p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://youtu.be/ah8mhDW6Shs"> Anita Sarkeesian's talk on YouTube</a>

<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.feministfrequency.com'>Anita Sarkeesian</a>:  <blockquote><p>I run an educational nonprofit called Feminist frequency, and host a series of essays on women in video games
<p>the video game industry is going through a huge change - women are making more game
<p>although the industry used to mainly cater to young men, and that is changing for good
<p>I have been made a folk demon by angry men as responsible for the change in the industry
<p>somehow they think that attacking me will stop the changes happening in the gaming industry
<p>I have had a campaign of threats of rape and murder and graphic pornography 
<p>I want to cover some more subtle ways I get harrassed
<p>impersonation is a tactic to attack me - fake accounts saying I was buying $1000 shoes - stereotypic misogyny
<p>a fake quote attributing me saying Mirrors Edge controls were too hard for women
<p>fake quotes become part of an information cascade - creating justification for further and extreme abuse
<p>There are also a series of conspiracy theories about me that are delusional
<p>"Anita bleached her skin to appear more white"
<p>there is one man on youtube who has made hundreds of rants about me, some over 4 hours long
<p>I am supposed to have used neurolingusitic programming to brainwash people
<p>there are no blipvets in my videos that change people's brains, though my rhetoric can do that
<p>4channers like to impersonate me to troll each other into further abuse. I've never posted there. You shouldn't either
<p>when I posted some of the death threats I received, I was accused of faking them by people making more threats 
<p>these conspiracy theories and hoaxes build on themselves with each new harassment
<p>the paranoia about feminists taking over video games is fueled by a deep distrust of women
<p>when women receive harassment and abuse we are blamed for it, 
<p>one of the most radical things you can do is actually believe women when they tell you about their experiences

<a class='h-card' href='http://waxy.org/'>Andy Baio</a>:  <blockquote><p>John Gruber wrote about Apple when they were still an underdog
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://daringfireball.net'>John Gruber</a>:  <blockquote><p>I assume that most of you have heard of Daring Fireball [lots of hands up] I also made Markdown in 2004 [cheers]
<p>I write about design, technology, sometimes I try to be funny, but what I write about most and best, is about Apple
<p>I wrote about Apple Computer - they're not even called that any more, they're Apple, Inc - a watch company
<p>it is probable that Apple made more profit over this weekend than they did in all of 2006
<p>the landscape of the independent web has changed since 2002
<p>I thought I was too late when I started blogging in 2002 - there were so many great blogs then
<p>Andy Baio, Dooce, Zeldman, textism were influences on Daring Fireball. Jason Kottke started his blog in 1978
<p>It wasn't too late in 2002. It's never too late. There was such a great chasm between the independent web and commercial web
<p>big commercial sites had big ugly CMS's that generated really ugly code.
<p>sites made by individuals writing under their own name had great source code that loaded fast #indieweb
<p>we had this opportunity - we were delivering higher quality work - higher production quality output
<p>it was nicer to read <a class="auto-link" href="http://kottke.org">kottke.org</a> than  the professional publications
<p>Anyone remember MacWeek? it was printed on big glossy paper and the size of the Daily news. I loved MacWeek
<p>you could not buy MacWeek - you had to fill out a form like a job applications to get a copy. I lied 3 or 4 times
<p>I think what gave me up was that the address was always a dorm room.
<p>How could one person on his own even vaguely compete with MacWeek?
<p>Samuel Johnson said "No man but a blockhead ever wrote, except for money" - the web turned that on its head
<p>right from the get-go when I started Daring Fireball, I wanted to figure out a way to make it my full time work
<p>in 2004 I started tinkering to see what sticks - I tried adsense when it came out. 
<p>I had one good month with adsense - I made an analogy with mens hairpieces and graphic design
<p>mens hairpieces look bad because they say "i'm paying lots fo money, I want more hair" - just like graphic design
<p>I started selling t-shirts for $29 and memberships for $19 - the t-shirt let me help them part with the money
<p>at the time I had an RSS feed that was excerpt only - the shitty kind of RSS feed
<p>I use an ad network called The Deck - they don't work on RSS feeds, just on the web.
<p>I made the full content feed a bonus for the members. I made a 10 char random string for each user's url
<p>I said "please don't share the full content URL" - it mostly worked people din't seem to share it
<p>circa 2006 people started using online aggregators like bloglines and when you searched for daring fireball you got them
<p>Bloglines made a sane assumption that the URLs were public, and it looked like I was bad at designing URLs
<p>Daring Fireball was a really nice hobby, but it was nowhere near my fulltime salary. 
<p>I realised I had to put the fulltime effort in to get the revenue for the fulltime money
<p>I announced on the site in public that I was going full time, I told people this was the time to sign up, and got $30-40k
<p>by the end of 2006 income crept up until it got to about our outgoings, and then it stuck
<p>in 2007 one company made a decision that made daring fireball a success -Google - they made Google Reader
<p>Google reader did not grasp password authenticated feeds, which I had switched to 
<p>I got daily letters asking how to get password authenticated feeds in Google Reader
<p>I realised that with password authenticated feeds Google Reader would have to fetch each one individually
<p>so to make Daring Fireball work in Google Reader I made the feed free. Putting ads in would be worthless
<p>so instead of adsense I sold my own ads as sponsored feeds - a post thanking them once a week
<p>I raised the price steadily over the years, and thanks to Google Reader I finally found a business model that worked
<p>the readers lie ethe sponsors - I reject ones that don't fit my audience
<p>there is a villain in this story and it is CPM - Cost Per iMpression -they can't even make the acronym right
<p>the problem with CPM is that there is no way to value one form of content over another
<p>I put a long article in sometimes, and I put it in the page and you can scroll down, because browsers work like that
<p>a 2000 word piece is one impression, so is a cat gif 
<p>breaking long essays into pages has a "click for next page" link which my dyslexia reads as "close this tab"
<p>this CPM driven pagination is disrespectful - it messes up the work. And it hasn't even worked
<p>I thought that web publications would figure out something better than CPM like I did, but instead they made CPM work
<p>things like buzzfeed and words like "listicle" make CPM work but at the cost of the web itself
<p>I know what I'm going to do in the future. I'm going to write Daring Fireball until I fucking die
<p>I thought that when I burst through and Heather Armstong did and Kottke did, more would join us
<p>when I started having a web design background was important, but then anyone could do it
<p>I hoped that each writer, under their own name, with their own site could work, but it hasn't really happened #indieweb
<p>the crowd sourcing things are starting to work - kickstarter doesn't work for ongoing things but Patreon does
<p>selling one ad a week and making it a scarce resource is a better idea than the CPM nonsense.
<p>Know when to be stubborn. I never considered CPM, or selling the site.
<p>Know when to be flexible - I gave up the paid feed thing that I was attached to 
<p>Prioritize quality over money. Apple's first priority is quality products; the 2nd priority is make enough money from them
<p>Priority order matters. You can often make more money by valuing what you make more.
<p>I just realised I spent 45 minutes paraphrasing the great philosopher king Kenny Rogers - Know when to hold 'em…
