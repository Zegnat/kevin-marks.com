<p><a class='h-card' href='http://waxy.org/'>Andy Baio</a>: if you've ever heard of the django programing framework, it's named because @adrianholovaty loves jazz guitar
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.holovaty.com/'>Adrian Holovaty</a>: is playing us guitar instead of speaking
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.holovaty.com/'>Adrian Holovaty</a>: my internet music story started when I got my dad the MacGyver box set, and I arranged the theme for guitar
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.holovaty.com/'>Adrian Holovaty</a>: my video on the YT homepage in 2007. 10% positive; 20% you suck; 20% self promo 30% MacGyver humour; 30% Tabs PLZ
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.holovaty.com/'>Adrian Holovaty</a>: I posted a jazz piece and commenters complained they wanted more 80s theme songs. So I did ducktales.
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.holovaty.com/'>Adrian Holovaty</a>: Richard Addrisi who wrote "Never My Love" emailed asking me for an MP3 of my version. 
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.holovaty.com/'>Adrian Holovaty</a>: A guy in France on the New Years Eve show used my recording of the America's Funniest Home Videos theme 6M saw it
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.holovaty.com/'>Adrian Holovaty</a>: People should do more Internet to real life arbitrage. I was the top result for Gypsy Jazz on YouTube, got gigs
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.holovaty.com/'>Adrian Holovaty</a>: After I played a wedding, I recorded 'here comes the bride' and got lots of requests for the MP3. So I sold it.
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.holovaty.com/'>Adrian Holovaty</a>: I get about one sale a day for $10 for my Here comes the Bride mp3, and about 1 a week for the Tabs
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.holovaty.com/'>Adrian Holovaty</a>: A huge proportion of the comments on any guitar piece on YouTube is "can I have the tabs?"
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.holovaty.com/'>Adrian Holovaty</a>: Guitar tablature misses out all the rhythmic information in standard music notation. So I made soundslice.com
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.holovaty.com/'>Adrian Holovaty</a>: Guitar tablature misses out all the rhythmic info in standard music notation. So I made soundslice.com
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.holovaty.com/'>Adrian Holovaty</a>: The intersection of musicians with musician fans and not widely pirated is what Pitch Perfect sells
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.holovaty.com/'>Adrian Holovaty</a>: We have tabs verified by the artists, sell those and give 70% to the artists: http://www.soundslice.com/pitch-perfect/
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.youtube.com/user/Vihart'>Vi Hart</a>: blends maths and music in such a succesful way on YouTube
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.youtube.com/user/Vihart'>Vi Hart</a>:  just tummeled the entire audience into singing harmonies with her and clapping along
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.youtube.com/user/Vihart'>Vi Hart</a>: I did a talk about computational balloon twisting to make a perfect icosohedron
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.youtube.com/user/Vihart'>Vi Hart</a>: I have a frozen presentation/and I don't know what to do/but with audience participation/i can make it about you
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.youtube.com/user/Vihart'>Vi Hart</a>: I thought "Vi Hart" was my name, but i've been told it is now a brand and not my name any more
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.youtube.com/user/Vihart'>Vi Hart</a>: If you're not facespacing your tweetbook then no-one will love you
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.youtube.com/user/Vihart'>Vi Hart</a>: when people are in real life you can't just ban or block them.
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.youtube.com/user/Vihart'>Vi Hart</a>: If you don't tell people to like your stuff, how will they know they like your stuff?
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.youtube.com/user/Vihart'>Vi Hart</a>: I'm releasing all my videos as torrents so I'm not surrounded by youtube stuff
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.youtube.com/user/Vihart'>Vi Hart</a>: Reddit attracts a lot of judgmental people because the site is all about judging things
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.youtube.com/user/Vihart'>Vi Hart</a>: This song is in AABA form, and the A part is AABA too, and the A is AABA too. It's in fractal form.
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://jackcheng.com'>Jack Cheng</a>: I worked on a novel in my spare time on nights and weekends for about 3 years, while founding a company
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://jackcheng.com'>Jack Cheng</a>: there are multiple levels of gatekeeping in publishing. Even a completed book it can take 18 months to get to print
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://jackcheng.com'>Jack Cheng</a>: it's good to honour examples of success, but we shouldn't worship them
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://jackcheng.com'>Jack Cheng</a>: JD Salinger wrote Catcher In The Rye while working in counterintelligence in WWII—weeding out the phonies Holden hates
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://jackcheng.com'>Jack Cheng</a>: Salinger wrote Catcher In The Rye while working in counterintelligence in WWII—weeding out the phonies Holden hates
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://jackcheng.com'>Jack Cheng</a>: when we make art, novels or songs, they are the purest mirrors of ourselves 
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://jackcheng.com'>Jack Cheng</a>: You don't have to quit your job and go all in on your art. If it's about healing+self discovery you can do it lifelong
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://medium.com/@ev/'>Evan Williams</a>: In 1993 I picked up a magazine, Wired. Saffo said "text is the cool new medium" It may have influenced me more than I knew
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://medium.com/@ev/'>Evan Williams</a>: In 1993 I made a video about how to get on the internet. I lived in fear for 10 years that someone would find it. 
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://medium.com/@ev/'>Evan Williams</a>: I worked on blogger for about 6 years. It wasn't about blogging, but realising the promise of the net
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://medium.com/@ev/'>Evan Williams</a>: The promise of the net was that everyone could share their thoughts and knowledge with everyone. Blogging did that.
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://medium.com/@ev/'>Evan Williams</a>: Back in my video, I described the internet as a puzzle made from computers, from information and from people
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://medium.com/@ev/'>Evan Williams</a>: Computers are still part of the internet, but we don't ever see them. We don't even see the wires any more.
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://medium.com/@ev/'>Evan Williams</a>: Back then there used to be people on the internet, and people who weren't. Now it's in the air: we make connections with it
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://medium.com/@ev/'>Evan Williams</a>: The internet is connections. Not just the links, but every song you play, everything you read, makes a recorded connection
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://medium.com/@ev/'>Evan Williams</a>: the internet is a giant machine to get people what they want. It makes human desires easier to fulfil. Convenience.
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://medium.com/@ev/'>Evan Williams</a>: Convenience on the internet comes from speed and cognitive ease. I don't want to wait and I don't want to think.
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://medium.com/@ev/'>Evan Williams</a>: part of the reason twitter was more convenient was that it reduce cognitive strain by eliminating so many choices
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://medium.com/@ev/'>Evan Williams</a>: Google makes it fast and easy. There's one box. You don't even need to spell what you want correctly
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://medium.com/@ev/'>Evan Williams</a>: Apple took one click from Amazon, and ruthlessly negotiated with the labels to make it all the same price - cognitive ease
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://medium.com/@ev/'>Evan Williams</a>: if you want to make a million dollar internet company, which is why we came to XOXO, make an old desire more convenient
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://medium.com/@ev/'>Evan Williams</a>: If you think that the internet superhighway just led to a convenience store, isn't that depressing?
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://medium.com/@ev/'>Evan Williams</a>: Agriculture freed us up to do many more things [clearly agriculture is a theme this year]
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://medium.com/@ev/'>Evan Williams</a>: the internet can enable us to compete against the conveniences made by mass industrialism. So lets make it worthwhile
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://waxy.org/'>Andy Baio</a>: @boingboing must be one of the longest running internet publications. It's impact on culture is very deep.
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://glog.glennf.com'>Glenn Fleishman</a>: BoingBoing was founded as a zine in 1998 by Mark - photocopied, stapled and distributed in record stores and head shops
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://glog.glennf.com'>Glenn Fleishman</a>: the zine had a paywall - you had to fill out a paper form. They also sold t-shirts.
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://glog.glennf.com'>Glenn Fleishman</a>: when California was legalizing marijuana, we thought about starting Bong Bong
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://boingboing.net'>Mark Frauenfelder</a>: I wanted a zine that covered my interests - cypherpunks, comics, all the things geeks liked as well as computers
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://boingboing.net'>Mark Frauenfelder</a>: instead of buying zines, I ended up trading subscriptions with people and met lots of writers that way
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://boingboing.net'>Mark Frauenfelder</a>: What I was interested in about punk was not so much the music as the do it yourself ethos

<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.ouya.tv'>Julie Uhrman</a>: Television has already changed, we're seeing a new creativity, but it hasn't happened in my creative industry, games
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.ouya.tv'>Julie Uhrman</a>: The game consoles are getting very expensive - they want to be the centre of your digital life now
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.ouya.tv'>Julie Uhrman</a>: Ouya has been described as "the Sundance of video games"
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.ouya.tv'>Julie Uhrman</a>: I can't sing, I only dance in clubs, I don't paint or make games, but I want to enable it
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.ouya.tv'>Julie Uhrman</a>: How do you describe Amazing Frog? it has no category - a frog jumping around a carpark in Swindon doing tricks
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.ouya.tv'>Julie Uhrman</a>: Astronaut Rescue's lead developer is an 8-year-old boy called Noah
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.ouya.tv'>Julie Uhrman</a>: we launched a matching program for Kickstarter projects. We so did not think of all the ways people could take advantage
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.ouya.tv'>Julie Uhrman</a>: one thing I can say about our mistakes is that we'll keep making them. We're young and scrappy
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.ouya.tv'>Julie Uhrman</a>: the reason you bring your games to Ouya is that every reddit thread, every tweet every blog about it we read
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.ouya.tv'>Julie Uhrman</a>: we learnt along the way that there is not much you can plan for. You have to react quickly, but think first.
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.ouya.tv'>Julie Uhrman</a>: theres nothing more powerful than a large group of people who believe in you
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://waxy.org/'>Andy Baio</a>: there are four Ouya's to be given away at XOXO, tell us what you would like to make with it
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://waxy.org/'>Andy Baio</a>: a theme here is fighting Imposter Syndrome - these speakers are just like us, but have something they want to make
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.marco.org/'>Marco Arment</a>: Instapaper was the first 'read later' service. I ran it for 5 years and it was a bit stressful
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.marco.org/'>Marco Arment</a>: there is a stress in running a large web service, and knowing that if you mess up millions of people will be upset
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.marco.org/'>Marco Arment</a>: The problem with parsing web pages is that HTML coders are crazy. They do insane things, and it's your problem
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.marco.org/'>Marco Arment</a>: The Apple Store rejecting your app is a big stressor - they can do it for any reason or no reason
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.marco.org/'>Marco Arment</a>: Apple change the rules all the time. They can add one at any time that bans an important feature of your app
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.marco.org/'>Marco Arment</a>: Then there's these guys, patent trolls [shows Nathan Myhrvold, audience boos] #fixpatents
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.marco.org/'>Marco Arment</a>: whatever patents are supposed to do to promote innovation is a load of crap, and a tax on creators
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.marco.org/'>Marco Arment</a>: My biggest fear is a FedEx overnight envelope, because they always come from lawyers
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.marco.org/'>Marco Arment</a>: for a while Instapaper was unchallenged, but then the others came by, and I didn't take it well
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.marco.org/'>Marco Arment</a>: save for later became a feature of everything - I went from competing with 2 10-person teams to Apple, Amazon et al
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.marco.org/'>Marco Arment</a>: All that competition didn't matter in the end. What mattered was what I did with my product
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.marco.org/'>Marco Arment</a>: Palm, Rim, Sega, 90's Apple all failed because they stopped executing, not because of the competition
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.marco.org/'>Marco Arment</a>: Marketshare doesn't matter - if you have enough people to sustain your business
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.marco.org/'>Marco Arment</a>: You don't need everyone to like you. You don't need everyone to like *only* you. Competition is often additive
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.marco.org/'>Marco Arment</a>: Why am I so bothered that my category became crowded?  I have a distaste for doing what everyone else is doing
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.marco.org/'>Marco Arment</a>: I loved You Are Boring by Scott Simpson: http://the-magazine.org/4/you-are-boring#.Uj87s2SY7BQ
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.marco.org/'>Marco Arment</a>: it's easy to be the only coffee snob you know in real life… well, maybe not here. But online they're all there.
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.marco.org/'>Marco Arment</a>: rather than avoiding the crowd, I need to ask if I'm adding anything. Do I need to be there?
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.marco.org/'>Marco Arment</a>: If I'm not adding anything, that's good - I can stop doing it and do something else
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.marco.org/'>Marco Arment</a>: Of course I'm making a podcast app. Because podcasts are awesome.
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.marco.org/'>Marco Arment</a>: Everything is a low barrier to entry in the podcast market
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.marco.org/'>Marco Arment</a>: Podcasts are a very intimate medium. The audience thinks they know you.
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.marco.org/'>Marco Arment</a>: Talking on a podcast is easier than writing, there are a lot of smart people who talk on podcasts before writing. 
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.marco.org/'>Marco Arment</a>: big media web publishing is a terrible business - look at all the bullshit on the page of business insider
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.marco.org/'>Marco Arment</a>: the economics of big media web sites is terrible. Podcasts don't allow publishers to do assholish things for money
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.marco.org/'>Marco Arment</a>: the top shows in podcasts will get hundreds of thousands of listeners, but they will be great fans
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.marco.org/'>Marco Arment</a>: Podcasting is a very human medium. No-one is "engaging with your brand" - you can be a person.
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.marco.org/'>Marco Arment</a>: platform n. - A middleman seeking to capture control
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.marco.org/'>Marco Arment</a>: The podcast world is pretty crowded already There's already Apple, Stitcher and others
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.marco.org/'>Marco Arment</a>: Apple has been asleep at the wheel with podcasts for years.
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.marco.org/'>Marco Arment</a>: the more I ask around, the more I hear that nobody loves their podcast app. I'm only 60% happy with them
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.marco.org/'>Marco Arment</a>: with podcast apps there are tons of tiny design decisions to be made along the way
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.marco.org/'>Marco Arment</a>: I'm making my favourite app. If you like it to that's great
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.marco.org/'>Marco Arment</a>: My podcast app is called Overcast - it's about halfway done, but the back end half. http://overcast.fm
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://xuhulk.tumblr.com/'>Christina Xu</a>: the Awesome Foundation is an international group of guerilla philanthropists
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://xuhulk.tumblr.com/'>Christina Xu</a>: I don't have an epic origin story. I'll tell you James Erwin's - it started with a reddit comment: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome_Sweet_Rome 
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://xuhulk.tumblr.com/'>Christina Xu</a>: James Erwin lost creative control of Rome Sweet Rome when it got optioned as a movie, so now he's writing Acadia
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://xuhulk.tumblr.com/'>Christina Xu</a>: We only just worked out what Breadpig is. Rather than being the high and mighty publisher, you are our client.
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://xuhulk.tumblr.com/'>Christina Xu</a>: if you create a system that only rewards trailblazers, you reward the hugely creative and the already privileged
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://xuhulk.tumblr.com/'>Christina Xu</a>: The Tyranny of Struturelessness means that the system you can't see is worse than the one you can
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://xuhulk.tumblr.com/'>Christina Xu</a>: hashtags were a norm that users created [@blaine threatened to filter them out of tweets at one point] 
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://xuhulk.tumblr.com/'>Christina Xu</a>: we need to complicate this idea of disintermediation. Its not just getting rid of the middle man, but changing the system
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://rugnetta.com'>Mike Rugnetta</a>: the best part of XOXO is watching @waxpancake be exasperated
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://rugnetta.com'>Mike Rugnetta</a>: I write an internet TV show called Idea Channel:  http://www.youtube.com/user/pbsideachannel
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://rugnetta.com'>Mike Rugnetta</a>: the successes of others can give permission to make things
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://rugnetta.com'>Mike Rugnetta</a>: People describe the internet as D-word tech [andy banned saying 'disruptive]
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://rugnetta.com'>Mike Rugnetta</a>: Disintermediation implies that there was infrastructure there that is being deconstructed.
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://rugnetta.com'>Mike Rugnetta</a>: the constructive internet is not a wrecking ball, it's a pathway.
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://rugnetta.com'>Mike Rugnetta</a>: Shakespeare and Nietzche had fandoms, but the internet makes it possible for them to be with each other
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://rugnetta.com'>Mike Rugnetta</a>: there must be a fandom without canonical media. There is. That fandom is furries.
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://rugnetta.com'>Mike Rugnetta</a>: not every creator sets out to create furry media, and the community debates what counts as part of furdom
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://rugnetta.com'>Mike Rugnetta</a>: the internet has changed the way that people can construct themselves.
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://rugnetta.com'>Mike Rugnetta</a>: you only know what you think and beleive based on your experiences
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://rugnetta.com'>Mike Rugnetta</a>: the internet is a tool that lets us peel away all our layers to get to that inside… thing
<p><a class='h-card' href='http://rugnetta.com'>Mike Rugnetta</a>: the internet is a tool that lets us peel away all our layers to get to that inside… thing
