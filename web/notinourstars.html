<h3>Brief summary for tweet length attention spans</h3>
We can get a lot of the much mourned favorite star on twitter by using 'add a comment' in retweet and tweeting a star emoji as a comment. eg:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="und" dir="ltr">ðŸŒŸ <a href="https://t.co/W9i12AfVBe">https://t.co/W9i12AfVBe</a></p>&mdash; Kevin Marks (@kevinmarks) <a href="https://twitter.com/kevinmarks/status/662006580267773953">November 4, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<h3>executive summary in bullet form</h3>
This has the following advantages:
<ul><li> Lets you use star again, or any other emoji that better expresses nuance.
<li>Notifies the person starred, just as 'like' does
<li>shows up in your feed (but not in your favorites list)
<li>works in all twitter clients as it shows the emoji and link by default, and the linked-to tweet in official ones
<li>can be liked and retweeted in its own right
</ul>
and some drawbacks:
<ul><li>is not counted as a like or a retweet (this is true for all quoted tweets)
<li>is a bit more obtrusive than the old favorite
<li>takes more than one click to create
</ul>

<h3>Historical exegesis and discussion of semiotics</h3>
Back in the dawn of twitter, new ways of using it were created by users, sporadically adopted, and then reified first by the vibrant client ecosystem, and eventually by official Twitter clients.
