<blockquote>Weâ€™re open to any technology development project with the potential to advance journalistic goals, give reporters new tools, and provide news consumers with better information.</blockquote>

<p>The web of news exploded with blogging at the turn of the millennium, and continues to change, but it's not going away. As the App bubble bursts and social platforms churn algorithms to maintain MAUs, it is time to focus on the web as independent substrate.

<p>I have spent the past few years working with a loose group of technologists, designers and writers building <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com">the IndieWeb</a>. Our goal is to keep the web independent, as we have all lost too much of it to site deaths. IndieWeb embraces connections to all ways of sharing stories following the POSSE principle - Publish on Own Site, Share Elsewhere. Indieweb is  not a monolithic implementation of an alternative social network, it is a set of protocols and practices with multiple implementations that build on one another and connect to everything.

<p>Indieweb is now at the point where we can do many useful things - comment federation; annotations as marginalia; sharing articles to social networks and gathering the remote comments; and the kind of social web interactions that seem to require silo solutions (likes, reposts, Invitations and RSVPs etc.)

<p>Bringing these facilities to enhance news on the web is an <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/generations">obvious next step</a> - journalists are the most engaged and connected users of social networks and the web, and they feel the need for these tools more than users who have settled on a single silo or two to exist within.

<p>My projects at Buzzfeed Open Lab would be to work with the rich palette of IndieWeb protocols and tools to assist in news gathering, reporting and circulation. 
<p>Deciding exactly which to deploy in which order would obviously require some evalution and research with working journalists, but examples would be:
<ul>
<li><p>Using micropub to refactor the frontend vs backend of journalist's CMS tools. The example of using the Quill editor with Known, Wordpress and Blogger backends shows how this can work.

<li><p>Using Webmention to collect and gather comments and responses from multiple social networks in a uniform form - bridgy connects these with big silos Facebook and Twitter.

<li><p>Using fragmention to provide highlighting and paragraph references across domains and silos, so medium-like commenting can happen anywhere.

<li><p>Combining vouch support for webmentions and follow lists to create a high value comment feed for journalists and individuals to pay attention to.
</ul>

<p>Because of the existing library of <a href="https://github.com/indieweb">open source</a> IndieWeb software and <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/projects">projects</a> there is plenty to build on and many collaborators already working on these protocols and codebases, and an active community I already take part in.

<p>I am confident that this would lead to rapid development of scalable cloud-hosted open source software that would deliver new journalistic tools and greater connections across the web between journalists and their readers.

<p>I hope you can consider me for the senior fellowship, as I think these tools and experiences would help rapidly grow and build other fellows ideas into prototypes, but I would also be interested in the open fellowship to build specific projects on this toolset.
