<p><a class='h-card' href='http://www.andrewmarks.media/'>Andrew Marks</a>:  <blockquote><p>has arrived in brighton safely
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>I'm the host here, as well as <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/adactio">@adactio</a> and <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/tommorris">@tommorris</a> - [plays squarespace video with indiewebcamp]
<p>in 2011 at a meeting discussing federated protocols, me, <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/caseorganic">@caseorganic</a>, <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/aaronpk">@aaronpk</a> <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/skinny">@skinny</a> started indiewebcamp to build things
<p>day 1 is discussion sessions, day 2 is hack sessions
<p>day 1 is discussion sessions - what we want to build, day 2 is hack sessions - actually building it
<p>if you go to <a class="auto-link" href="https://indiewebcamp.com/irc/">https://indiewebcamp.com/irc/</a> you can see what we're saying; <a class="auto-link" href="https://talky.io/indiewebcamp">https://talky.io/indiewebcamp</a> you can hear us
<p>now it's time for introductions and demos - show us your website and how you are using it
<p>the newest thing I did was adding https to my site <a class="auto-link" href="https://tantek.com">https://tantek.com</a> so I can post securely
<p>I need help fixing my rel-me auth now, so if anyone wants to help find me
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://adactio.com/'>Jeremy Keith</a>:  <blockquote><p>If you post a comment to my site using webmention I can work out which post you are using with h-entry
<p>after webmentions I got notes working and copying to twitter via POSSE
<p>I am using <a class="auto-link" href="http://brid.gy">brid.gy</a> to propagate to twitter and get  comments back on my own posts
<p>I added photo posting, which I upload to my site and make various sizes for different screens viewing it
<p>I post photos to my own site, but send copies to twitter so there is a backup there and to flickr too
<p>this saves the monolithic task of posting to multiple places, but I haven't brought my old pix back from flickr yet
<p>I would like to also POSSE to Instagram but there is no API call to post to instagram except from their app
<p>there is <a class="auto-link" href="http://ownyourgram.com">ownyourgram.com</a> that lets you copy back photos from instagram, which is almost what I want, but my site should be the true one
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://tommorris.org/'>Tom Morris</a>:  <blockquote><p>this is my site, <a class="auto-link" href="http://tommorris.org/">http://tommorris.org/</a> , which is not as responsive as it could be; it's primarily text-based
<p>
<p>
<p>I use Mozilla Persona to sign in as it didn't need me to pretend to be an app to sign in
<p>when I'm logged in it just shows my posting interface at the top of the page, with title, content, POSSE boxes+license
<p>the feature I have added recently is location <a class="auto-link" href="http://tommorris.org/places">tommorris.org/places</a> - which has London AND Brighton
<p>I use <a class="auto-link" href="http://geodienste.lyrk.de">geodienste.lyrk.de</a> for map tiles that serve over https, and use OpenStreetMap place objects with lat long

<a class='h-card' href='http://sammachin.com'>Sam Machin</a>:  <blockquote><p>at indiewebcmap last year I showed a really early hack of owning my own communications
<p>the problem is that I don't own my phone number, but i can connect to it over WebRTC
<p>the idea is that we can replace all forms of contact - phone, chat, whatever with URLs
<p>you can call me by going to my page - <a class="auto-link" href="http://sammachin.github.io/talk/">sammachin.github.io/talk/</a> is frontend; a lot of backend I am running
<p>you go to my URL to call me, and I decide how you connect depending on where I am 
<p>voicemail is shit - everyone hates it, so give better alternatives
<p>If you log into my site with indieauth, I can show you more ways to contact me, based on how I know you
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://natwelch.com'>Nat Welch</a>:  <blockquote><p>I have a bunch of different sites that did webmentions and such, and it got annoying, so on the train ride I changed it 
<p>my old sites were <a class="auto-link" href="http://pseudoweb.net">pseudoweb.net</a> (long form) <a class="auto-link" href="http://sadnet.com">sadnet.com</a> to be tweeted at and now at /natnatnat
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://voxpelli.com'>Pelle Wessman</a>:  <blockquote><p>I got tired of hosting my own server so I move to Jekyll on github pages for everything at <a class="auto-link" href="http://voxpelli.com">http://voxpelli.com</a>
<p>I have javascript that embeds webmentions using <a class="auto-link" href="http://webmention.herokuapp.com">webmention.herokuapp.com</a> to show them on a static site
<p>you add a rel=webmention link to point to this and some javascript to copy to your page embed the webmentions
<p>I also wrote a tool to test webmentions + make sure you aren't allowing script injections called webmention-testpinger

<a class='h-card' href='http://glennjones.net/'>Glenn Jones</a>:  <blockquote><p>last year I showed my posts written in HTML in a folder, but now I use my phone to take pictures and checkin
<p>I built a new system <a class="auto-link" href="http://transmat.io">transmat.io</a> that is broken into sections that make sense on a phone
<p>if you look at <a class="auto-link" href="http://transmat.io/glennjones">transmat.io/glennjones</a> you can see what I have posted
<p>contenteditable is very hard to work with. I have to link URLs, @'s and #'s myself to make it usable
<p>I added a UI to set up POSSE so it will then post to other sites like Twitter as well
<p>everything  on the site, if you add /json to a URL will parse the microformats of the page and make JSON form it
<p>All the HTML is stored locally so even if <a class="auto-link" href="http://transmat.io">transmat.io</a> goes down I could staticly host it somewhere else
<p>I've built this up experimentally, but am considering running this as a service like <a class="auto-link" href="http://brid.gy">brid.gy</a>
<p>I have a "reclaim your tweets" feature where you download the zipfile from twitter and it adds only the new ones
<p>the twitter archive doesn't give you all the context info you need, so I scrape twitter to fix that
<p><a class="auto-link" href="http://transmat.io">transmat.io</a> is all built on node.js - it imports account info for each person I interact with so I have context
<p>I generate an hCard for each person including twitter, name and website, and have started adding places too
<p>see <a class="auto-link" href="http://transmat.io/glennjones/places">transmat.io/glennjones/places</a> for what I have found from my tweets, but I snap to fences in places I know
<p>I have my own near.html page that shows me the places I have been to before to snap to common ones

<p>craft is at <a class="auto-link" href="http://buildwithcraft.com">http://buildwithcraft.com</a> - I added a geolocation plugin to craft
<p>somebody already wrote webmention sending for craft; I added reciving them

<a class='h-card' href='http://www.andrewmarks.media/'>Andrew Marks</a>:  <blockquote><p>I'm Andrew Marks- my dad is on that computer there -wave to him
<p>I have my own site at andrewmarks.media running on Known - I use soundcloud and wordpress mainly
<p>I can post a photo of my dad and it will webmention him if I link it
<p>I can checkin here using Known and get an openstreetmap link http://www.andrewmarks.media/2014/checked-into-68-middle-street
<p>I also have a site at <a class="auto-link" href="http://kcltheatre.com">kcltheatre.com</a> on Known and I'm working out how to use this for actors too

<p>I am building my own site in rails on heroku and plan to make it more indieweb compatible

<a class='h-card' href='http://waterpigs.co.uk'>Barnaby Walters</a>:  <blockquote><p>I'm Barnaby Walters at <a class="auto-link" href="http://waterpigs.co.uk">http://waterpigs.co.uk</a> and I've been building a reader since last year
<p>I got distracted by building intertubes based on yahoo pipes which is a reader construction kit
<p>but then I made <a class="auto-link" href="http://shrewdness.waterpigs.co.uk/">http://shrewdness.waterpigs.co.uk/</a> which looks like tweetdeck but only parses microformats 2
<p>I get twitter info via a twitter to microformats 2 proxy converter too
<p>I also have a search column that works via elasticsearch on whatever it has seen already
<p>you can also reply to things - I support <a class="auto-link" href="http://indiewebcamp.com/micropub">indiewebcamp.com/micropub</a> so you can post replies on your own site
<p>if you log in to shrewdness with your site using indieauth you can post to it in reply by micropub

<a class='h-card' href='http://alpower.com'>Al Power</a>:  <blockquote><p>If i'd spent as much time creating content as tinkering with CMS's I'd have a multi-thousand page blog
<p>I want to make photo uploading really easy - trying out kirby and perch

<a class='h-card' href='http://jkphl.is'>Joschi Kuphal 吉</a>:  <blockquote><p>I have implemented webmentions on my site <a class="auto-link" href="http://jkphl.is">http://jkphl.is</a> using TYPO3, a popular CMS in eastern europe
<p>I want to add photo and note posting and implement these in typo3 too

<p>I want to use my front end designs with an indieweb-based backend

<a class='h-card' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>I need a volunteer who has an iPad, as I want to show Icon use.
<p>by adding an icon to your homepage, your friends can add your face to their homescreens and get to you clickly
<p>so I've been thinking about how to make the person first and the contact secondly see <a class="auto-link" href="http://tantek.com/2014/120/b1/markup-people-focused-mobile-communication">http://tantek.com/2014/120/b1/markup-people-focused-mobile-communication</a>
<p>if you go to <a class="auto-link" href="http://tantek.com/contact.html">http://tantek.com/contact.html</a> you can click through to contact me directly
<p>this is all built in html+css, no javascript, so it is faster than native applications
<p>the other part of this is communicating how you want to be contacted to people in a way that looks like apps
<p>I need to add a time-based version so if I'm asleep it will turn off facetime, for example
