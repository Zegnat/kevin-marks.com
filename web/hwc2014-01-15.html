<a class='h-card' href='http://benwerd.com/'>Ben Werdmüller</a>:  <blockquote><p>the big achievement last year was the webcomment thread that became a gateway to connect people to the indieweb
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://snarfed.org/'>Ryan Barrett</a>:  <blockquote><p>this year lots of people have heard about IndieWeb, now we are connecting to non-coders and have to handle spam
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://benwerd.com/'>Ben Werdmüller</a>:  <blockquote><p>this thread of webcomments has become a gateway: https://eschnou.com/entry/testing-indieweb-federation-with-waterpigscouk-aaronpareckicom-and--62-24908.html

<a class='h-card' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>The number of questions being asked in this community encourage me - do we want unique sites or an indieweb install
<p>the question "how many implementations do we need?" stumped me. 1 is clearly too few; Millions is clearly too many. Thousands!
<p>when the building blocks are simple enough that we have thousands of implementations, we have the right building blocks
<p>Thousands mean we have made things easy enough for anyone skilled in the craft to implement. You can't shut down thousands
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://upon2020.com/'>Johannes Ernst</a>:  <blockquote><p>If we're going to get to thousands, we are going to need marketing, much as I hate it
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://benwerd.com/'>Ben Werdmüller</a>:  <blockquote><p>The usability of the social layer itself that we are building is key: none of us are typical users. Indieweb needs memes
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://snarfed.org/'>Ryan Barrett</a>:  <blockquote><p>indiewebcamp.com/why is the best answer: own your data; self dogfood; rough consensus and running code
<p>Have your own domain is key - you can then move it. POSSE is next
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href=''>Scott</a>:  <blockquote><p>The indieweb Why page is mostly based on fear - you look like survivalists or a militia
<p></blockquote>

<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://upon2020.com/'>Johannes Ernst</a>:  <blockquote><p>POSSE use case for banks - you send money on your own site between banks, and POSSEs to the financial world
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>POSSE banking is like personal electronic mattress. [did Johannes just invent POSSEcoin]
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://mathpunk.net'>Tom Henderson</a>:  <blockquote><p>I want my website to be at least as useful as paper - I can tell my mood from handwriting and sketchiness
<p>I don't want everything chronological, I want to make my own piles of information 
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://snarfed.org/'>Ryan Barrett</a>:  <blockquote><p>people were driven to snapchat by a pain - because they were scared of persistence of data
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>we're falling into the 'design for the masses' antipattern. Barnaby said build what it takes to stop you using facebook
<p>until you have it working for yourself, forget marketing. Build it, do it, only then speak it.</blockquote>
