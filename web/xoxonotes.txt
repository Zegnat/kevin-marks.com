#xoxofest @waxpancake: if you've ever heard of the django programing framework, it's named because @adrianholovaty loves jazz guitar
#xoxofest @adrianholovaty is playing his guitar instead of speaking. Lovely
#xoxofest @adrianholovaty: my internet music story started when I got my dad the MacGyver box set, and I arranged the theme for guitar
#xoxofest @adrianholovaty: my video on the YT homepage in 2007. 10% positive; 20% you suck; 20% self promo 30% MacGyver humour; 30% Tabs PLZ
#xoxofest @adrianholovaty: I posted a jazz piece and commenters complained they wanted more 80s theme songs. So I did ducktales.
#xoxofest @adrianholovaty: Richard Addrisi who wrote "Never My Love" emailed asking me for an MP3 of my version. 
#xoxofest @adrianholovaty: A guy in France on the New Years Eve show used my recording of the America's Funniest Home Videos theme 6M saw it
#xoxofest @adrianholovaty: People should do more Internet to real life arbitrage. I was the top result for Gypsy Jazz on YouTube, got gigs
#xoxofest @adrianholovaty: After I played a wedding, I recorded 'here comes the bride' and got lots of requests for the MP3. So I sold it.
#xoxofest @adrianholovaty: I get about one sale a day for $10 for my Here comes the Bride mp3, and about 1 a week for the Tabs
#xoxofest @adrianholovaty: A huge proportion of the comments on any guitar piece on YouTube is "can I have the tabs?"
#xoxofest @adrianholovaty: Guitar tablature misses out all the rhythmic information in standard music notation. So I made soundslice.com
#xoxofest @adrianholovaty: Guitar tablature misses out all the rhythmic info in standard music notation. So I made soundslice.com
#xoxofest @adrianholovaty: The intersection of musicians with musician fans and not widely pirated is what Pitch Perfect sells
#xoxofest @adrianholovaty: We have tabs verified by the artists, sell those and give 70% to the artists: http://www.soundslice.com/pitch-perfect/
#xoxofest @waxpancake: @vihartvihart blends maths and music in such a succesful way on YouTube that she has 600,000 subscribers
#xoxofest @vihartvihart:  just tummeled the entire audience into singing harmonies with her and clapping along
#xoxofest @vihartvihart: I did a talk about computational balloon twisting to make a perfect icosohedron
#xoxofest @vihartvihart: I have a frozen presentation/and I don't know what to do/but with audience participation/i can make it about you
#xoxofest @vihartvihart: I thought "Vi Hart" was my name, but i've been told it is now a brand and not my name any more
#xoxofest @vihartvihart: If you're not facespacing your tweetbook then no-one will love you
#xoxofest @vihartvihart: when people are in real life you can't just ban or block them.
#xoxofest @vihartvihart: If you don't tell people to like your stuff, how will they know they like your stuff?
#xoxofest @vihartvihart: I'm releasing all my videos as torrents so I'm not surrounded by youtube stuff
#xoxofest @vihartvihart: Reddit attracts a lot of judgmental people because the site is all about judging things
#xoxofest @vihartvihart: This song is in AABA form, and the A part is AABA too, and the A is AABA too. It's in fractal form.
#xoxofest @jackcheng: I worked on a novel in my spare time on nights and weekends for about 3 years, while founding a company
#xoxofest @jackcheng: there are multiple levels of gatekeeping in publishing. Even a completed book it can take 18 months to get to print
#xoxofest @jackcheng: it's good to honour examples of success, but we shouldn't worship them
#xoxofest @jackcheng: JD Salinger wrote Catcher In The Rye while working in counterintelligence in WWII—weeding out the phonies Holden hates
#xoxofest @jackcheng: Salinger wrote Catcher In The Rye while working in counterintelligence in WWII—weeding out the phonies Holden hates
#xoxofest @jackcheng: when we make art, novels or songs, they are the purest mirrors of ourselves 
#xoxofest @jackcheng: You don't have to quit your job and go all in on your art. If it's about healing+self discovery you can do it lifelong
#xoxofest @ev: In 1993 I picked up a magazine, Wired. Saffo said "text is the cool new medium" It may have influenced me more than I knew
#xoxofest @ev: In 1993 I made a video about how to get on the internet. I lived in fear for 10 years that someone would find it. 
#xoxofest @ev: I worked on blogger for about 6 years. It wasn't about blogging, but realising the promise of the net
#xoxofest @ev: The promise of the net was that everyone could share their thoughts and knowledge with everyone. Blogging did that.
#xoxofest @ev: Back in my video, I described the internet as a puzzle made from computers, from information and from people
#xoxofest @ev: Computers are still part of the internet, but we don't ever see them. We don't even see the wires any more.
#xoxofest @ev: Back then there used to be people on the internet, and people who weren't. Now it's in the air: we make connections with it
#xoxofest @ev: The internet is connections. Not just the links, but every song you play, everything you read, makes a recorded connection
#xoxofest @ev: the internet is a giant machine to get people what they want. It makes human desires easier to fulfil. Convenience.
#xoxofest @ev: Convenience on the internet comes from speed and cognitive ease. I don't want to wait and I don't want to think.
#xoxofest @ev: part of the reason twitter was more convenient was that it reduce cognitive strain by eliminating so many choices
#xoxofest @ev: Google makes it fast and easy. There's one box. You don't even need to spell what you want correctly
#xoxofest @ev: Apple took one click from Amazon, and ruthlessly negotiated with the labels to make it all the same price - cognitive ease
#xoxofest @ev: if you want to make a million dollar internet company, which is why we came to XOXO, make an old desire more convenient
#xoxofest @ev: If you think that the internet superhighway just led to a convenience store, isn't that depressing?
#xoxofest @ev: Agriculture freed us up to do many more things [clearly agriculture is a theme this year]
#xoxofest @ev: the internet can enable us to compete against the conveniences made by mass industrialism. So lets make it worthwhile
#xoxofest @waxpancake: @boingboing must be one of the longest running internet publications. It's impact on culture is very deep.
#xoxofest @GlennF: BoingBoing was founded as a zine in 1998 by Mark - photocopied, stapled and distributed in record stores and head shops
#xoxofest @GlennF: the zine had a paywall - you had to fill out a paper form. They also sold t-shirts.
#xoxofest @pesco: when California was legalizing marijuana, we thought about starting Bong Bong
#xoxofest @Frauenfelder: I wanted a zine that covered my interests - cypherpunks, comics, all the things geeks liked as well as computers
#xoxofest @Frauenfelder: instead of buying zines, I ended up trading subscriptions with people and met lots of writers that way
#xoxofest @pesco: What I was interested in about punk was not so much the music as the do it yourself ethos

#xoxofest @juhrman: Television has already changed, we're seeing a new creativity, but it hasn't happened in my creative industry, games
#xoxofest @juhrman: The game consoles are getting very expensive - they want to be the centre of your digital life now
#xoxofest @juhrman: Ouya has been described as "the Sundance of video games"
#xoxofest @juhrman: I can't sing, I only dance in clubs, I don't paint or make games, but I want to enable it
#xoxofest @juhrman: How do you describe Amazing Frog? it has no category - a frog jumping around a carpark in Swindon doing tricks
#xoxofest @juhrman: Astronaut Rescue's lead developer is an 8-year-old boy called Noah
#xoxofest @juhrman: we launched a matching program for Kickstarter projects. We so did not think of all the ways people could take advantage
#xoxofest @juhrman: one thing I can say about our mistakes is that we'll keep making them. We're young and scrappy
#xoxofest @juhrman: the reason you bring your games to Ouya is that every reddit thread, every tweet every blog about it we read
#xoxofest @juhrman: we learnt along the way that there is not much you can plan for. You have to react quickly, but think first.
#xoxofest @juhrman: theres nothing more powerful than a large group of people who believe in you
#xoxofest @waxpancake: there are four Ouya's to be given away at XOXO, tell us what you would like to make with it
#xoxofest @waxpancake: a theme here is fighting Imposter Syndrome - these speakers are just like us, but have something they want to make
#xoxofest @marcoarment: Instapaper was the first 'read later' service. I ran it for 5 years and it was a bit stressful
#xoxofest @marcoarment: there is a stress in running a large web service, and knowing that if you mess up millions of people will be upset
#xoxofest @marcoarment: The problem with parsing web pages is that HTML coders are crazy. They do insane things, and it's your problem
#xoxofest @marcoarment: The Apple Store rejecting your app is a big stressor - they can do it for any reason or no reason
#xoxofest @marcoarment: Apple change the rules all the time. They can add one at any time that bans an important feature of your app
#xoxofest @marcoarment: Then there's these guys, patent trolls [shows Nathan Myhrvold, audience boos] #fixpatents
#xoxofest @marcoarment: whatever patents are supposed to do to promote innovation is a load of crap, and a tax on creators
#xoxofest @marcoarment: My biggest fear is a FedEx overnight envelope, because they always come from lawyers
#xoxofest @marcoarment: for a while Instapaper was unchallenged, but then the others came by, and I didn't take it well
#xoxofest @marcoarment: save for later became a feature of everything - I went from competing with 2 10-person teams to Apple, Amazon et al
#xoxofest @marcoarment: All that competition didn't matter in the end. What mattered was what I did with my product
#xoxofest @marcoarment: Palm, Rim, Sega, 90's Apple all failed because they stopped executing, not because of the competition
#xoxofest @marcoarment: Marketshare doesn't matter - if you have enough people to sustain your business
#xoxofest @marcoarment: You don't need everyone to like you. You don't need everyone to like *only* you. Competition is often additive
#xoxofest @marcoarment: Why am I so bothered that my category became crowded?  I have a distaste for doing what everyone else is doing
#xoxofest @marcoarment: I loved You Are Boring by Scott Simpson: http://the-magazine.org/4/you-are-boring#.Uj87s2SY7BQ
#xoxofest @marcoarment: it's easy to be the only coffee snob you know in real life… well, maybe not here. But online they're all there.
#xoxofest @marcoarment: rather than avoiding the crowd, I need to ask if I'm adding anything. Do I need to be there?
#xoxofest @marcoarment: If I'm not adding anything, that's good - I can stop doing it and do something else
#xoxofest @marcoarment: Of course I'm making a podcast app. Because podcasts are awesome.
#xoxofest @marcoarment: Everything is a low barrier to entry in the podcast market
#xoxofest @marcoarment: Podcasts are a very intimate medium. The audience thinks they know you.
#xoxofest @marcoarment: Talking on a podcast is easier than writing, there are a lot of smart people who talk on podcasts before writing. 
#xoxofest @marcoarment: big media web publishing is a terrible business - look at all the bullshit on the page of business insider
#xoxofest @marcoarment: the economics of big media web sites is terrible. Podcasts don't allow publishers to do assholish things for money
#xoxofest @marcoarment: the top shows in podcasts will get hundreds of thousands of listeners, but they will be great fans
#xoxofest @marcoarment: Podcasting is a very human medium. No-one is "engaging with your brand" - you can be a person.
#xoxofest @marcoarment: platform n. - A middleman seeking to capture control
#xoxofest @marcoarment: The podcast world is pretty crowded already There's already Apple, Stitcher and others
#xoxofest @marcoarment: Apple has been asleep at the wheel with podcasts for years.
#xoxofest @marcoarment: the more I ask around, the more I hear that nobody loves their podcast app. I'm only 60% happy with them
#xoxofest @marcoarment: with podcast apps there are tons of tiny design decisions to be made along the way
#xoxofest @marcoarment: I'm making my favourite app. If you like it to that's great
#xoxofest @marcoarment: My podcast app is called Overcast - it's about halfway done, but the back end half. http://overcast.fm
#xoxofest @xuhulk: the Awesome Foundation is an international group of guerilla philanthropists
#xoxofest @xuhulk: I don't have an epic origin story. I'll tell you James Erwin's - it started with a reddit comment: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome_Sweet_Rome 
#xoxofest @xuhulk: James Erwin lost creative control of Rome Sweet Rome when it got optioned as a movie, so now he's writing Acadia
#xoxofest @xuhulk: We only just worked out what Breadpig is. Rather than being the high and mighty publisher, you are our client.
#xoxofest @xuhulk: if you create a system that only rewards trailblazers, you reward the hugely creative and the already privileged
#xoxofest @xuhulk: The Tyranny of Struturelessness means that the system you can't see is worse than the one you can
#xoxofest @xuhulk: hashtags were a norm that users created [@blaine threatened to filter them out of tweets at one point] 
#xoxofest @xuhulk: we need to complicate this idea of disintermediation. Its not just getting rid of the middle man, but changing the system
#xoxofest @mikerugnetta: the best part of XOXO is watching @waxpancake be exasperated
#xoxofest @mikerugnetta: I write an internet TV show called Idea Channel:  http://www.youtube.com/user/pbsideachannel
#xoxofest @mikerugnetta: the successes of others can give permission to make things
#xoxofest @mikerugnetta: People describe the internet as D-word tech [andy banned saying 'disruptive]
#xoxofest @mikerugnetta: Disintermediation implies that there was infrastructure there that is being deconstructed.
#xoxofest @mikerugnetta: the constructive internet is not a wrecking ball, it's a pathway.
#xoxofest @mikerugnetta: Shakespeare and Nietzche had fandoms, but the internet makes it possible for them to be with each other
#xoxofest @mikerugnetta: there must be a fandom without canonical media. There is. That fandom is furries.
#xoxofest @mikerugnetta: not every creator sets out to create furry media, and the community debates what counts as part of furdom
#xoxofest @mikerugnetta: the internet has changed the way that people can construct themselves.
#xoxofest @mikerugnetta: you only know what you think and beleive based on your experiences
#xoxofest @mikerugnetta: the internet is a tool that lets us peel away all our layers to get to that inside… thing
