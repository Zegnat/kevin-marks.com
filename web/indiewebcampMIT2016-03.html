<p><div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://aaronparecki.com/'>Aaron Parecki</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>Hello Indiewebcamp MIT - we're going to do demos now
<p>Kevin is going to livetweet this so if you have a phone you may get bombarded with @ mentions
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.w3.org/People/Sandro/'>Sandro Hawke</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I'm Sandro Hawke I have lots of websites including <a class="auto-link" href="http://hawke.org">hawke.org</a>
<p>what stops me from having a website is that I have lots of different websites
<p>I migrated all my tweets from twitter to my w3 site <a class="auto-link" href="http://www.w3.org/People/Sandro/">http://www.w3.org/People/Sandro/</a>
<p>on <a class="auto-link" href="https://www.w3.org/People/Sandro/blog/">https://www.w3.org/People/Sandro/blog/</a> I load all my tweets from my export via javascript
<p>twitters data export is very nice, especially compared to facebook which I couldn't make sense of
<p>there is metadata in the link saying what the real link is so I converted it to use that

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://cassie.wtf'>Cassie</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I'm Cassie, my main site is cassie.wtf, but I have been working on <a class="auto-link" href="http://sensible.mn">sensible.mn</a> 
<p>the blog is still running known, but the pages are now in wordpress
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://annbass.net'>Ann Bassetti</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I got my own site <a class="auto-link" href="http://annbass.net">annbass.net</a> up and running on Known, and hooked up to twitter <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/annbass">@annbass</a>
<p>I'm running my own instance of <a class="auto-link" href="http://withknown.com">withknown.com</a> on dreamhost
<p>I set up my own site so people can learn how to keep their own parent at home when they need assistance
<p>I'm using known and have <a class="auto-link" href="http://brid.gy">brid.gy</a> set up to connect to twitter
<p>I have a lot of posts to write, and I need to organise them, probably using tags
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://ben.thatmustbe.me'>Ben Roberts</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I'm Ben and my site is <a class="auto-link" href="https://ben.thatmustbe.me">https://ben.thatmustbe.me</a> if you got ot <a class="auto-link" href="https://ben.thatmustbe.us">https://ben.thatmustbe.us</a> it picks a random ben for you
<p>I got fed up with Cordova's complete lack of documentation so worked on my web posting UI instead
<p>I added offline storage of drafts so I can edit things offline and then submit the stored post when I get online
<p>I can save multiple offline posts, and it stores the time when you hit save, not when you posted
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.w3.org/People/Sandro/'>Sandro Hawke</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>satra had to leave early, but  <a class="auto-link" href="http://satra.cogitatum.org">satra.cogitatum.org</a> is built on the SoLiD platform
<p>it should allow other people to log in, but I don't have certificates. it looks pretty
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I'm tantek of <a class="auto-link" href="http://tantek.com">tantek.com</a> and I spent most of indiewebcamp documenting events and how to model them
<p>I wanted to model birthdays in a useful way as that is a strong case for facebook so we can make them distributed
<p>thre is information at <a class="auto-link" href="http://indiewebcamp.com/birthday">http://indiewebcamp.com/birthday</a> on our thinking on how to share these
<p>we also spent time working out how to model events with invitations, and the ui is tricky to get right
<p>if anyone has libraries for simple natural language event parsing I'd like to hear about them
<p>I took time to document how facebook's event mobile UI which has regressed from 2014 <a class="auto-link" href="http://indiewebcamp.com/event#Facebook">http://indiewebcamp.com/event#Facebook</a>
<p>I have changed how photos work on my site - I want interactions on both silo copies to come to one post
<p>before I couldn't do multiple copies to the same silo; now there are 2 of them
<p>If it's the same content, I want it to be the same permalink

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href=''>Jessica</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I manage a website for a band, and I get it set up on Drupal, moving from Joomla 
<p>I found it really easy to put photos up with a block of text and customise it
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://aaronparecki.com/'>Aaron Parecki</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I'm Aaron of <a class="auto-link" href="http://aaronparecki.com">http://aaronparecki.com</a> - I had intended to work onevent presentation and event UI
<p>but i got event presentation working
<p>on <a class="auto-link" href="http://aaronparecki.com/events">aaronparecki.com/events</a>  I have events show for multi-day events  - it show start time, location and city
<p>if you click on an event you see more information, including RSVPs and mentions eg <a class="auto-link" href="https://aaronparecki.com/2016/03/14/1/indiewebcamp">https://aaronparecki.com/2016/03/14/1/indiewebcamp</a>
<p>the other thing I got working last night was getting iOS share action to behave
<p>so this post was sent from my iphone via a share extension to micropub: <a class="auto-link" href="https://aaronparecki.com/2016/03/15/2/">https://aaronparecki.com/2016/03/15/2/</a>
<p>now I'm going to try a pano, just to make it harder
<p>what I learned last night was that id didn't work because the images were so big and I hit memory limits on iOS
<p>I found that I need to set the size of the viewport smaller so it doesn't run out of memory

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://rhiaro.co.uk'>Amy</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I made a service to send notification to SoLiD servers, which is like webmentions but can have more data
<p>I send a message to Dmitri from my site, the message gets stored in his inbox, and this reader shows it 
<p>I'm particuarly happy with this client becaude it works with javascript off, unlike the other SoLiD apps
<p>my page is <a class="auto-link" href="http://apps.rhiaro.co.uk/errol">apps.rhiaro.co.uk/errol</a> and dmitri's is <a class="auto-link" href="https://dzagidulin.databox.me">https://dzagidulin.databox.me</a>

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://shevski.com'>Irina Bolychevsky</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I have had a website for really long time, but the content is 2 years out of date <a class="auto-link" href="http://shevski.com">http://shevski.com</a>
<p>the content is marked up with microformats, and linked so I can log into indiewebcamp with my site
<p>and I set up a user page on the wiki at <a class="auto-link" href="http://indiewebcamp.com/User:Shevski.com">http://indiewebcamp.com/User:Shevski.com</a>

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://agaric.com'>Chris</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>We are talking about platform cooperativism
<p>so what if you had something like Uber but the drivers had ownership and a login on the platform
<p>when it  comes to indiewebcamp there are barriers to entry for owning a domain name and paying for hosting
<p>an example of platform cooperativism would be something like <a class="auto-link" href="http://withknown.com">withknown.com</a> where you can offer logins
<p>another example would be <a href="http://www.aegirproject.org/">Aegir</a> on Drupal
<p>I am a member of Agaric, <a class="auto-link" href="http://agaric.com">http://agaric.com</a> a worker owned cooperative with 5 owners at the moment
<p>there is <a class="auto-link" href="http://internetofownership.net/">http://internetofownership.net/</a> which is collecting platforms that promote cooperatives 
<p>we're also working on how to convert a startup like entity to members
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://aaronparecki.com/'>Aaron Parecki</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>Thanks everybody for your demos
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.ibiblio.org/hhalpin'>harryhalpin</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>There's a lot going on in the standards space at the moment, and we should agree on federation and syntax soon
<p>in the pre-indieweb era of federation there was a lot of concern about security and privacy eg Salmon
<p>We now have some cryptographers looking at the problem of communicating privately in distributed way
<p>one part is key exchange - how you show keys and share changes, and we have  signed model with Merkle trees
<p>we're sponsoring a blockchain summerschool too
<p>and looking at a mix-network that is a Tor-like thing to prevent traffic monitoring
<p>I will try to get an indieweb enabled site up over the next day or two
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://aaronparecki.com/'>Aaron Parecki</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>thanks to everyone for coming, for MIT for hosting, and to NLNet and Sovrn for sponsoring food
