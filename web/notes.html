<h2>IndieWebCamp UK Notes</h2>

<p><a href='http://tantek.com'>Tantek Çelik</a>: some of you may have seen this before: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lB95KLmpLR4 you want control, but to talk to friends in gilded silos
<p><a href='http://tantek.com'>Tantek Çelik</a>: you may have seen this before: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lB95KLmpLR4 you want control, but to talk to friends in gilded silos
<p><a href='http://tantek.com'>Tantek Çelik</a>: you should have your own website - if you don't you're an apprentice, and someone here will help you set one up
<p><a href='http://aralbalkan.com'>Aral Balkan</a>: I have the most manual blogging tool:  markdown gets compiled using codekit to make static files that I ftp to my site
<p><a href='http://aralbalkan.com'>Aral Balkan</a>: tools liek Ulysses have helped me focus on my writing, not on the process
<p><a href='http://tantek.com'>Tantek Çelik</a>: I don't even have an interface like @Aral does - I write HTML straight into a flat file editing dates by hand, scp it up
<p><a href='http://tantek.com'>Tantek Çelik</a>: the only UI I have is to make the post into a tweet and tweet that. It also sends a PubSubHubbub notification 
<p><a href='http://adactio.com'>Jeremy Keith</a>: my website is a "CMS" I made myself, and it's awful. PHP and MySQL and ancient. I like the non-DB trend.
<p><a href='http://adactio.com'>Jeremy Keith</a>: Generally I don't open comments on my posts - Sturgeon's Law applies. You can post a comment, but can't see others
<p><a href='http://adactio.com'>Jeremy Keith</a>: If you want to write a reply to my blogpost on your site, I'd like that. I hope to get Webmentions working this weekend
<p><a href='http://lmjabreu.com/'>Luis Abreu</a>: I've used wordpress but got frustrated. Now I use scriptogr.am that uses markdown in a posts folder on dropbox. 
<p><a href='http://glennjones.net'>Glenn Jones</a>: I used to use wordpress, but I just started this yesterday. My data is stored as HTML.
<p><a href='http://glennjones.net'>Glenn Jones</a>: I process microfomats-2 into JSON versions. I have data interfaces that show up automatically
<p><a href='http://glennjones.net'>Glenn Jones</a>: the data is on transmat.io which has a simple data format that creates an API
<p><a href='http://caseorganic.com'>Amber Case</a>: mediawiki hosts my site. I take screenshots with skitch that posts to flickr and a cronjob pulls them to my site.
<p><a href='http://caseorganic.com'>Amber Case</a>: between the wiki and the photo site I can get this done, but have protection against a ToS deletion from flickr
<p><a href='http://sammachin.com'>Sam Machin</a>: I'm at sammachin.com I hate phone numbers, so go to sammachin.com/callme and it will call me with WebRTC
<p><a href='http://sammachin.com'>Sam Machin</a>: when you hit 'call me' it checks foursquare to see which country I'm in to know which phone to call.
<p><a href='http://sammachin.com'>Sam Machin</a>: a phone number is more like an IP address. Phone numbers are horrible things, and temporary
<p><a href='http://sammachin.com'>Sam Machin</a>: The page can know which time zone I'm in, and switch to voicemail appropriately
<p><a href='http://sixtwothree.org'>Jason Garber</a>: I'm at http://sixtwothree.org but http://sketchnotes.sixtwothree.org is what I use, running on Jekyll 'cos I like ruby
<p><a href='http://sixtwothree.org'>Jason Garber</a>: I have a command line UI where I give it a title and a URL, and it creates the post's YAML then I edit
<p><a href='http://sixtwothree.org'>Jason Garber</a>: I want to bring this system back onto my main site so I can use markdown which is nicer than HTML to write
<p><a href='http://knitatoms.net'>Tom Atkins</a>: I use acryl
<p><a href='http://knitatoms.net'>Tom Atkins</a>: my site is knitatoms.net - it's an anagram of Tom Atkins
<p><a href='http://knitatoms.net'>Tom Atkins</a>: once i've edited it I have a script to deploy it to my site.
<p><a href='http://smus.com'>Boris Smus</a>: http://smus.com runs a blogging engine I built myself in python. 
<p><a href='http://smus.com'>Boris Smus</a>: I author in markdown with YAML upfront, then run a comandline builder that previews drafts, then posts
<p><a href='http://smus.com'>Boris Smus</a>: I've been working on a GUI to post things quickly, called Lightning, which creates a draft preview
<p><a href='http://smus.com'>Boris Smus</a>: it's supposed to post to twitter and G+, do the whole POSSE thing - I'll work on that this weekend
<p><a href='http://nightlight.ws'>mime čuvalo</a>: my site is http://nightlight.ws, powered by https://github.com/mimecuvalo/helloworld
<p><a href='http://nightlight.ws'>mime čuvalo</a>: it creates an RSS feed you can follow, and lets me edit posts inline, or make comments
<p><a href='http://nightlight.ws'>mime čuvalo</a>: I have a Pinterest-like bookmarklet that makes it easy to repost pictures form the web
<p><a href='http://michalstefanow.com'>Michal Stefanow</a>: I'm at http://michalstefanow.com - I don't have a good workflow, and too many websites
<p><a href='http://michalstefanow.com'>Michal Stefanow</a>: I want to build something to post to one site and connect it to all these sites - that's what I want to make here
<p><a href='http://aaronparecki.com'>Aaron Parecki</a>: I'm at http://aaronparecki.com - it's homegrown, built in PHP called p3k
<p><a href='http://aaronparecki.com'>Aaron Parecki</a>: my posting UI is a separate system from this site that generates these files for me in a web form
<p><a href='http://aaronparecki.com'>Aaron Parecki</a>: I have a twitter preview, then it puts a file on my server, and posts it to twitter via the API
<p><a href='http://aaronparecki.com'>Aaron Parecki</a>: When I display it on my site, it uses WebMentions to connect the comments together, as well as twitter threadind
<p><a href='http://aaronparecki.com'>Aaron Parecki</a>: starting with what was a static site, I as able to incrementally add the UI piece by piece.
<p><a href='http://waterpigs.co.uk'>Barnaby Walters</a>: I'm at http://waterpigs.co.uk I post everything from my iPad, using a special email address
<p><a href='http://waterpigs.co.uk'>Barnaby Walters</a>: Here's a vine-style video of you all saying "Yay Indieweb" http://waterpigs.co.uk/notes/4RvAta/
<p><a href='http://amirchaudhry.com'>Amir Chaudhry</a>: I'm at http://amirchaudhry.com I am interested in the internet of things and connecting them to sites
<p><a href='http://www.kevin-marks.com'>Kevin Marks</a>: my site is now www.kevin-marks.com due to an accident with DNS
