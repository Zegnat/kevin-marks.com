#NextEconomy @NickHanauer: There are positive feedback loops between customers and businesses that creates jobs
#NextEconomy @NickHanauer: impoverishing workers can't work out
#NextEconomy @NickHanauer: reasonable distributions of wealth generate far more economic dynamism than unequal ones
#NextEconomy @timoreilly: so why aren't you a communist?
#NextEconomy @NickHanauer: when I talk about inequality, I am not arguing for equality, but a productive amount of inequality
#NextEconomy @NickHanauer: people will be angry now and riotous if things get work. this isn't communism, this is common sense
#NextEconomy @NickHanauer: the people most in favour of less inequality are capitalists like me
#NextEconomy @timoreilly: is the fear of innovation technology and robots founded in reality
#NextEconomy @NickHanauer: what matters is not accumulation of money in society but accumulation of solutions to problems
#NextEconomy @NickHanauer: all technological innovation brings disruption wiht it, and the cooler the innovation the bigger the disruption
#NextEconomy @NickHanauer: you must match the rate of technological innovation wiht equal amounts of civic innovation
#NextEconomy @timoreilly: when you say civic innovation you don't mean it's governments job to fix, but the we need to take civics seriously
#NextEconomy @NickHanauer: all civilisation depends on solving collective action problems 
#NextEconomy @NickHanauer: should we hack our way through the woods with machetes or should we have roads?
#NextEconomy @timoreilly: it seems you are making a call to self-interest to your fellow plutocrats - the pitchforks are coming
#NextEconomy @timoreilly: you also want to get policy innovation going on minimum wage in one city and see it spread
#NextEconomy @NickHanauer: we are trying to change the frame of the debate around civic policy nationally
#NextEconomy @NickHanauer: the $15 minimum wage sounded crazy and outlandish when we started talking about it
#NextEconomy @NickHanauer: Seattle now pays tipped workers 500% more than the federal minimum, and now has the best restaurants bar SF
#NextEconomy @NickHanauer: when you pay restaurant workers well enough to eat in restaurants, the whole economy improves
#NextEconomy @NickHanauer: I grew up in a family business  that felt we had a social responsibility to the community
#NextEconomy @NickHanauer: economics is the way communities instantiate their social and moral prejudices about power
#NextEconomy @NickHanauer: we need to acknowledge that institutions are yielding to networks and plan for that to happen
#NextEconomy q: people believe that CEOs and companies drive the economy
#NextEconomy @NickHanauer: Trump said "our wages are to high" but he didn't mean himself. He believes his high wage is good for economy
#NextEconomy @NickHanauer: if you say to poor people hanging on by their fingernails "if govt make me raise wages I'll fire youâ€¦" 
#NextEconomy @NickHanauer: 
#NextEconomy @NickHanauer: it's a triple threat "if you force us to pay our workers fairly we will fire them"
#NextEconomy @timoreilly: there is a myth of a set of standardised skills and standardised credentials - we're reinventing that
#NextEconomy @timoreilly: how do we build and education to jobs pipeline that is built for the networked era?
#NextEconomy @timoreilly: Reid wrote a fantastic article on self driving cars https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/driving-networked-age-reid-hoffman
#NextEconomy @reidhoffman: people want to make the most effective investment of their own capital in employment
#NextEconomy @reidhoffman: what ameks entrepreneurs succesful is networks of investors, employees talant
#NextEconomy @ZoeBairdMarkle: there is a profound transformation of our economy from digitisation and globalisation
#NextEconomy @ZoeBairdMarkle: we built institutions to serve the industrial age, we need to do it for the digital age
#NextEconomy @NickHanauer: trickle down economics is an intimidation tactic masquerading as an economic theory
#NextEconomy @reidhoffman: I wrote a piece on disrupting education - they key thing is to have ongoing learning while working
#NextEconomy @reidhoffman: employers need to recognise more micro certifications from these kinds of ongoing education
#NextEconomy @ZoeBairdMarkle: for decades we've been telling americans that they need a college degree to succeed but 70% don't have them
#NextEconomy @ZoeBairdMarkle: we need to create a new kind of robust labour market for middle skilled employees
#NextEconomy @reidhoffman: we're tryign this out in one city with te assumption we can scale this to multiple cities
#NextEconomy @timoreilly: there is an interesting question of signalling - is there a skills mismatch or is the signalling bad?
#NextEconomy @ZoeBairdMarkle: it's changing for people in this room, but not more for the middle skilled
#NextEconomy @ZoeBairdMarkle: an undergraduate in CS at Yale thought she had to take coding bootcamp to get a job
#NextEconomy @ZoeBairdMarkle: people don't have a clue what to tell their kids to study, and how to show their skills when done
#NextEconomy @ZoeBairdMarkle: we have $1Trillion in college debt, yet many of those people are on low-wage low skill jobs
#NextEconomy @timoreilly: we're cracking down on private schools that are feeding on this debt system, what else?
#NextEconomy @reidhoffman: we need to get employers to recognise which of these certifications provide the right signalling for their work
#NextEconomy @ZoeBairdMarkle: there is a need for some of the funding that goes inot college loans to go into apprenticeships as well
#NextEconomy @BlackGirlsCode: if you teach one girl, she will naturally turn around and teach 5,6 or 10 more
#NextEconomy @BlackGirlsCode: we started Black Girls Code in a basement with a few people, only one of whom could code
#NextEconomy @BlackGirlsCode: when I looked in the rooms of conferences and meetup events, I didn't see anyone who looked like me
#NextEconomy @BlackGirlsCode: when we brought the girls in they were inspired by the design thinking and brought their friends and parents
#NextEconomy @BlackGirlsCode: our programme grew from the basement into an international organisation with 10 in the US, 1 in South Africa
#NextEconomy @BlackGirlsCode: I found 45 places from Sydney Australia to a small town in Alabama who were looking for opportunites
#NextEconomy @BlackGirlsCode: African American women achieve only 3% of CS degrees; Latinas 1%, Native Americans <1%
#NextEconomy @BlackGirlsCode: more than 45% of African American Girls are not graduating from high school at all, and graduate slowest
#NextEconomy @BlackGirlsCode: one fo the things that we found was that the girls brought their moms to classrooms too
#NextEconomy @BlackGirlsCode: the training became exponential as the girls trained their peers and mothers to code as well
#NextEconomy @BlackGirlsCode: Rebecca only came to our class because her father made her, but she flourished and excelled
#NextEconomy @BlackGirlsCode: Ida was on a school computer and told the teacher she was showing girls how to make a website
#NextEconomy @BlackGirlsCode: the teacher then set Ida up with an after school programme at her school to teach the girls
#NextEconomy @BlackGirlsCode: what I see when I look at these examples is that girls are natural change agents
#NextEconomy @BlackGirlsCode: I believe the work we are doing with Black Girls code is more than coding - it changes perception too
#NextEconomy @BlackGirlsCode: Girls of colour receive greater punitive and zero tolerance policies, and end in the school to prison pipeline
#NextEconomy @BlackGirlsCode: we need only turn on our TV to see a 250lb officer sitting on a black girl at a pool party
#NextEconomy @BlackGirlsCode: images showing black girls coding, building robots challenge the media portrayal of black girls
#NextEconomy @BlackGirlsCode: I started as a mom who was interested in technology
#NextEconomy @BlackGirlsCode: my job as a mom and as the founder of Black Girls Code is to not let these girls fail
#NextEconomy @BlackGirlsCode:  a girl wore her "black girls code" shirt to school. Teacher: "why black girls?" 'Because black girls matter'
#NextEconomy @timoreilly: Stephane Kasriel's upwork is an online marketplace for freelance work
#NextEconomy @skasriel: we want to connect companies with talent wherever they are, for knowledge work
#NextEconomy @skasriel: about half of our business is software development, web design etc
#NextEconomy @skasriel: the other half is  knowledge work like content marketing, graphic design, anything that can be done remotely
#NextEconomy @skasriel: we do about $1B/year in 80 different categories
#NextEconomy @skasriel: one of the most recnt developments is that many of the fortune 500 companies are starting to use this
#NextEconomy @skasriel: our biggest client has more than 10,000 freelancers working for them
#NextEconomy @timoreilly: you use a lot of freelancers yourself to build upwork?
#NextEconomy @skasriel: you have to dogfood we have about 250 employees and 700 freelancers
#NextEconomy @timoreilly: so you're also an example of a distributed workforce. 
#NextEconomy @timoreilly: How do you think about the workers on your platform - what do you do for them?
#NextEconomy @skasriel: if you look at frictions in the labour market today, 1% of global GDP is lost to supply/demand mismatch
#NextEconomy @skasriel: what are the main sources of inefficiency in labour: location is one- we have great engineers in Louisiana
#NextEconomy @skasriel: the jobs are over-concentrated in cites that are too expensive to live in
#NextEconomy @skasriel: the next thing is trust - hiring is about trust, I need to know the employee is trustworthy
#NextEconomy @skasriel: as the duration of jobs keeps going down, trust becomes more and more important
#NextEconomy @skasriel: we provide a reputation system that helps build trust quickly for short term work
#NextEconomy @skasriel: the 3rd thing is matching jobs with workers
#NextEconomy @skasriel: one of the most complex parts is matching as quickly as possible - hiring takes 4 weeks; we manage in 2 days
#NextEconomy @skasriel: who is qualified? who will be interested? are they available now?
#NextEconomy @skasriel: how do you try to direct the flow to get the optimum match between open jobs and available free lancers
#NextEconomy @skasriel: we want to reduce the amount of time people spend writing job descriptions and long cover letters
#NextEconomy @skasriel: the overarching story is that the resume is dead. The half life of a skill is trending down
#NextEconomy @skasriel: what is it that you know and what are you interested in doing are key
#NextEconomy @skasriel: an established freelancer who has done hundreds, thousands of hours on a platform we don't need to assess
#NextEconomy @skasriel: for an established freelancer I can tell them what they are good at - which PHP frameworks etc
#NextEconomy @skasriel: clients tend to hire people with lots of feedback; we need to nudge them to consider new people
#NextEconomy @skasriel: you need to get a nanojob and a nanodegree and a few more nanodegrees and jobs
#NextEconomy @StevenLevy: does anyone find it disturbing that the guy in charge of hiring at google leads for kills in assassins creed?
#NextEconomy @LaszloBock2718: It's like House of Cards there
#NextEconomy @StevenLevy: I dis book about google and was impressed with google getting evreryone's GPAs and only hire from good schools
#NextEconomy @StevenLevy: Larry Page would vet every single candidate
#NextEconomy @LaszloBock2718: when you are a small company it is efficient to only go to a few places. we changed that
#NextEconomy @LaszloBock2718: we looked at how people actually perfrom compared to where they went to school, and found no relationship
#NextEconomy @LaszloBock2718: there is a smalla dvantag 2 yeras in, but no difference after 5 years or so, so we stopped looking at schools
#NextEconomy @StevenLevy: so it wasn't so much a prejudice but a shortcut?
#NextEconomy @LaszloBock2718: the most predictive thing is a work function test - get them to do the work
#NextEconomy @LaszloBock2718: the next thing is structured testing and structured questions, whcih predicts better
#NextEconomy @LaszloBock2718: by doing this we hired a more diverse group of people by assessing more directly like this
#NextEconomy @StevenLevy: google broke new ground by setting very high standards and interviewing for ages
#NextEconomy @LaszloBock2718: we found more than 4 interviews didn't make a difference to performance so we cut them down
#NextEconomy @StevenLevy: when we say everyone hs to be an A player,we are missing out a lot of good people
#NextEconomy @LaszloBock2718: we looked for people who weren't the superstars but made other people work better and found them
#NextEconomy @StevenLevy: google was among the first to release a diversity report on gender and ethnicity. you really fell short
#NextEconomy @LaszloBock2718: we put eh data out there to have an honest conversation and to show that we had to improve
#NextEconomy @LaszloBock2718: this also makes hold ourselves accountable. we improved the representation of women by 1% last year
#NextEconomy @LaszloBock2718: 1 of our engineers went to Howard university for 6 months and improved their CS degree, now we hire from there
#NextEconomy @LaszloBock2718: we have a small improvement, but we need to do more
#NextEconomy @LaszloBock2718: we considered hiring al the diverse people from other tech companies, but decide that wasn't right
#NextEconomy @StevenLevy: why don't you include age in your published data?
#NextEconomy @LaszloBock2718: we look at age, we look at veterans, we also look at neurodiversity
#NextEconomy @LaszloBock2718: we built all this unconscious bias training; we wanted to check that we made improvements before sharing
#NextEconomy @LaszloBock2718: everyone knows what good management looks like, but it sucks because it is boring to do
#NextEconomy @LaszloBock2718: we surveyed each employee to rate managers on these obvious skills every 6 months, and saw improvevement
#NextEconomy @LaszloBock2718: a lot of management stuff is boring gruntwork, but you can solve it with a checklist
#NextEconomy @StevenLevy: is there a project in google for self driving managers?
#NextEconomy @LaszloBock2718: I can't disclose that
#NextEconomy q: do we have a shortage of tech workers?
#NextEconomy @LaszloBock2718: we look for a broad background and deep knowledge of one area
#NextEconomy @LaszloBock2718: we're not great at assessing people but we do focus on the wrong things
#NextEconomy q: how do you capture creativity?
#NextEconomy @LaszloBock2718: we do very little testing we do structured interview questions
#NextEconomy @LaszloBock2718: we take all the answers to thr structured questions and have independent blind review
#NextEconomy @LaszloBock2718: job descriptions are terrible - when superstars switch companies they revert to mean 
#NextEconomy @satyanadella: Imagine writing a memo that accurately conveyed emotion as well as meaning
#NextEconomy @timoreilly: is speech becoming a first class interface at microsoft?
#NextEconomy @satyanadella: first we had the PC operating system, then the browser, an agent is the 3rd runtime
#NextEconomy @satyanadella: the agent is the new app model - what if you can transcend the apps and speech becomes the new ui
#NextEconomy @satyanadella: you can do complex tasks that span applications - it's like browsing the web and browsing the app ecosystem
#NextEconomy @satyanadella: with Cortana, Siri, google now and Alexa there are lots of version of this model
#NextEconomy @satyanadella: it isn't just speech, sometimes it is just text - a bot interface between an app and an agent frontend
#NextEconomy @timoreilly: there is a lot of platform infrastructure to do this AI right - location is key
#NextEconomy @timoreilly: to say 'next time i am at whole foods remind me to buy currants' - how do we make that platform available?
#NextEconomy @satyanadella: the shopping cart example is a good one- you could build apps that plug into events that the agent triggers
#NextEconomy @satyanadella: the agent shoudl work to surface your ui whenever it is relevant
#NextEconomy @timoreilly: there si a lot of data science in the next generation logistics apps are you going to make a platform for that
#NextEconomy @satyanadella: are you directing attention via your UI or are you pluggin in their ui
#NextEconomy @satyanadella: if you come from advertising you are going to skew your agent towards suggesting apps
#NextEconomy @satyanadella: as we monetise differently it will define how we interact wiht the apps
#NextEconomy @satyanadella: statistical machine learning is changing every field and we have a role there as a platform company
#NextEconomy @satyanadella: what we did with Kinect and so on was put it into Azure as AzureML - we want to democratise it
#NextEconomy @timoreilly: AzureML is democratising machine learning for lots of compnaies
#NextEconomy @satyanadella: Thyssen Krupp is an elevator company that moved to being a SaaS company that maintains elevators using Azure
#NextEconomy @satyanadella: they decided to service other companies elevators too as hey had the teams in place
#NextEconomy @timoreilly: how do we augment workers to make them more productive?
#NextEconomy @satyanadella: productivity comes down to land, labour and capital - we want to drive those 3 factors of production
#NextEconomy @satyanadella: augmentation is the race wiht the machine - AI is inevitable, how do we design the human in the loops
#NextEconomy @satyanadella: the mahcine gets more leverage from capital, the human gets more leverage from the labour
#NextEconomy @satyanadella: eg Skype translate is for reducing transaction cost by crossing language boundaries
#NextEconomy @satyanadella: the notion of time matters - we need to apply our attention - the scarce commodity - more wisely
#NextEconomy @satyanadella: we have a product called Delve that analyses how you spend your time and helps you prioritise
#NextEconomy @satyanadella: how can Ai ultimately augment your productivity so you can get a higher return on your time
#NextEconomy @satyanadella: we see AR and VR as distinct - we're betting on AR
#NextEconomy @satyanadella: the dominant VR scenario next year will be PC based, for next year at least
#NextEconomy @satyanadella: we have built VR mirror worlds in the past, but if we can put objects back into the real worldâ€¦
#NextEconomy @satyanadella: we put the NASA martian rovers in their office to review
#NextEconomy q: A question about culture - what metaphors do we need for ordinary people to live with Big Data and AI?
#NextEconomy @satyanadella: we debated Cortana - should we give this a personality, should it be someone you can relate to
#NextEconomy @satyanadella: we are now working on how Cortana will take on cultural attributes of the different parts of the world
#NextEconomy @satyanadella: there is a project called Xiaoice in china that is very close to Her
#NextEconomy Brian Mullins: DAQRI makes an augmented reality helmet that is the interface for the internet of things
#NextEconomy Brian Mullins: we have created computer enhanced systems that can let workers see heat with thermal cameras 
#NextEconomy Brian Mullins: when the smart helmet identifies a piece fo equipment it will tell the worker what needs to be done
#NextEconomy Brian Mullins: Augmented Reality is in use in Kazakhstan in a steel mill combining real time information with thermal imaging
#NextEconomy Brian Mullins: the worker can just glance at the machine and see all the information they need to operate it
#NextEconomy Brian Mullins: part of Uber's sucess is that ost of us know how to drive; in industrial space there is less transferable
#NextEconomy Brian Mullins: what if you could put on a helmet and do any job? if we can empower them to solve problems by showing data
#NextEconomy Brian Mullins: Hyperloop is another of our partners. here's a sneak peek of what they are doing with our helmet
#NextEconomy Brian Mullins: the remote expert can see through the eyes of the worker and give them more information on the spot
#NextEconomy Brian Mullins: this worker is using the smart helmet to see what is inside the container
#NextEconomy @timoreilly: uber thinks it has a social mission. are you delusional? How do you persuade society?
#NextEconomy @davidplouffe: when uber staretd their aims were quite modest - to get their friends around town in towncars
#NextEconomy @davidplouffe: as Uber grew it showed that there was more available there
#NextEconomy @davidplouffe: a big problem in govt was how do we get more income to more people
#NextEconomy @davidplouffe: what we see with Uber we have a lot of people who drive part time just to augment their wages
#NextEconomy @timoreilly: we had an uber driver who felt trapped as he had bought a car to work for uber and had to wrk full time
#NextEconomy @timoreilly: some are advantaged, some are disdvantaged
#NextEconomy @davidplouffe: a lot fo the data around Uber and Lyfy is around what happens to the taxi market, and we aren't interested
#NextEconomy @davidplouffe: 50% of uber trips are one way - we are part of a multimodal system
#NextEconomy @davidplouffe: 10% of milennials are giving up cars and using Uber as part of that
#NextEconomy @davidplouffe: when we talk to drivers who do this 40 hours a week desire flexibility as well as part time
#NextEconomy @davidplouffe: a lot of drivers do this while looking for other kinds of work too
#NextEconomy @davidplouffe: we have restricted the ability to make money by driving for decades
#NextEconomy @davidplouffe: at the same time we have been forcing people into car ownership as taxis and transit are rare
#NextEconomy @timoreilly: so in addition to taxi companies hating you you'll have car companies hating you
#NextEconomy @timoreilly: how much time do you spend thinking about the worker value proposition?
#NextEconomy @davidplouffe: the number 1 reason people were trapped in poverty was the lack of access to transportation
#NextEconomy @davidplouffe: if we can bring down the price of transportation to parts of town we can change economy
#NextEconomy @davidplouffe: 2/3 of our drivers vary their own schedule based on their own control
#NextEconomy @davidplouffe: on-call scheduling has been a big problem, and we don't do that, drivers set schedules
#NextEconomy @davidplouffe: when we last reported 14% of drivers were women; now it is over 20%
#NextEconomy @timoreilly: what I'd love to see is more data released so we get beyond battling anecdotes and researchers can check things 
#NextEconomy @timoreilly: how should uber be regulated?
#NextEconomy @davidplouffe: services like uber aren't outlawed, most regulations are pre GPS and cellphone
#NextEconomy @davidplouffe: in germnay you need to return to your base before picking up someone else
#NextEconomy @davidplouffe: we have a lot of new laws on ride-sharing like Sydney and the Phillipines
#NextEconomy @davidplouffe: in france 25% of our most recent drivers were unemployed, but it takes 240 hours fo training
#NextEconomy @timoreilly: how much training is taken away by technology versus still required?
#NextEconomy @davidplouffe: we lose 1.2 million people a year in traffic accidents; we think we can help safety
#NextEconomy Eric Barajas: As an uber driver I am not making as much money that you are saying
#NextEconomy @davidplouffe: come and talk to our SF office and we can see what we can do
#NextEconomy Eric Barajas: There is no threat of deactivation if I speak up like this?
#NextEconomy @davidplouffe: the rating system is for passenger safety, not for punishing people who speak out
#NextEconomy q: there is a lot of debate between 1099 vs w2 - should there be a new class of labour?
#NextEconomy @davidplouffe: we are confident that we will hold up independent contractors up in court
#NextEconomy Lynda Chin : you have been talking about augmenting human expertise
#NextEconomy Lynda Chin : I have been in cancer genomics for a decade, and want to target cancer like a sniper not a carpet bomber
#NextEconomy Lynda Chin : most oncologists were trained 20-30 yeras ago before this kind of genomics was possible so there is a gap 
#NextEconomy Lynda Chin : we are seeing a disparity of care that is significant enough to be a life versus death decision
#NextEconomy Lynda Chin : what we want to do with technology is to capture the expertise so we can share it
#NextEconomy Lynda Chin : how many in the audience have the sense that you don't want to go to a hospital in july when new doctors come in?
#NextEconomy Lynda Chin : the system is Oncology Expert Advice that is a hybrid of human expertise and Watson inferences
#NextEconomy Lynda Chin : we train Watson with the literature and the background knowledge and treat it like a new medical student
#NextEconomy Lynda Chin : Watson reads the medical charts - not just the structured data but the free text notes too
#NextEconomy Lynda Chin : it then compares the extracted records wiht the literature and makes recommendations, then the experts edit it
#NextEconomy Lynda Chin : we are training the system to make predictions and have them corrected by our experts
#NextEconomy @timoreilly: how far are we from having this deployed?
#NextEconomy Lynda Chin : not 2 years, more like 5 years before this is clinical use
#NextEconomy Lynda Chin : our goal is to share the expertise of a specialist with a generalist
#NextEconomy Lynda Chin: The work with oncology made me realise that we could change how we think about healthcare to be like amazon
#NextEconomy Lynda Chin: working on diabetes is about taking it outside the hospital and into mobile clinics and into the home
#NextEconomy @ZoeBairdMarkle: if we're going to have income growth in a competitive market we are going to have to expand the jobs available
#NextEconomy @ZoeBairdMarkle: most new jobs come from entrepreneurs and small businesses - we need both policy and platforms
#NextEconomy @ZoeBairdMarkle: one is enabling small and medium sized businesses to reach world markets - look at Ali Baba in China
#NextEconomy @ZoeBairdMarkle: it is possible to export service businesses now with internet video and communication
#NextEconomy @ZoeBairdMarkle: there is a developing digital divide between small businesses and large businesses - Big Data for big biz
#NextEconomy @timoreilly: you are mostly in agreement and working on the same approach that govt has a role addressing market failure
#NextEconomy @ZoeBairdMarkle: Marco Rubio is making some fo the comments that we are making  - these new economy ideas are not partisan
#NextEconomy @ZoeBairdMarkle: It is a matter of the government thinking of a digtal age agenda not an industrial agenda
#NextEconomy @neeratanden: both parties are being concerned about economic inequality and shrinking middle class
#NextEconomy @neeratanden: it comes out in the immigration debate as well as the welfare debate
#NextEconomy @neeratanden: there is a lot of populist rhetoric on the republican side that responds to the inequality issue
#NextEconomy @timoreilly: should we have more immigration or build a wall?
#NextEconomy @neeratanden: I see immigration as a positive
#NextEconomy @FeliciaWongRI: So do I, i think we can bring in a broad coalition fro immigration reform
#NextEconomy @timoreilly: what about TPP?
#NextEconomy @neeratanden: we're focused on trade as a positive thing - you can have trade deals that create upwards pressure on wages
#NextEconomy @neeratanden: people confuse globalization and trade - we don't have a bilateral deal wiht china
#NextEconomy @FeliciaWongRI: it's not clear if this trade deal does what it promises or is it an alliance of global elites against people
#NextEconomy @neeratanden: I am not a fan of negotiation behind closed doors but we shoudl judge the language directly
#NextEconomy @timoreilly: new president is coming in a year from now with this huge income gap - how do we think of investment?
#NextEconomy @neeratanden: the most important thing we can do is to reject fatalism - the trends are not fatal to us
#NextEconomy @neeratanden: other countries have found ways to face these trends and preserve their middle income families - learn from them
#NextEconomy @ZoeBairdMarkle: before we even get to the president being elected, once we get to a 2 party discussion we will see the visions
#NextEconomy @ZoeBairdMarkle: the biggest challenge for this presidential election is to be talking about the future not ideas from the past
#NextEconomy @ZoeBairdMarkle: we're in a disaggreagated network world now and how we capitalise on that is what matters
#NextEconomy @FeliciaWongRI: this is an incredibly exciting politcal moment; policy change is possible there are new ideas like Basic Income
#NextEconomy @byron_auguste: I'm goign to start with what is motivating me to opportunity at work
#NextEconomy @byron_auguste: in 1950 Detroit was the richest city in america, with a broad middle class. in 1970 they could have good jobs
#NextEconomy @byron_auguste: In 1970, my father saw an advert for a COBOL programming course and got a career as a programmer
#NextEconomy @byron_auguste: that was 45 years ago, and my life has been very differnt becasue of it
#NextEconomy @byron_auguste: 45 years from now is 2060 and much will have changed by then, but its not robots that are the threat
#NextEconomy @byron_auguste: employment is our most important market - the Labor Market is $8.5T compared to $280B for software
#NextEconomy @byron_auguste: a year of inadvertant joblessness is as significant as losing a limb or a spouse
#NextEconomy @byron_auguste: Amoral machinery and institutions set the agenda in the name of "efficiency"
#NextEconomy @byron_auguste: the labor market has become a wildly inefficient 'efficiency' machine with crude clockwork rules
#NextEconomy @byron_auguste: employers have made a 4 year college degree as a barrier, not a bridge
#NextEconomy @byron_auguste: it
#NextEconomy @byron_auguste: it's not milennial job hopping that is the problem, it is employers laying off far more than before
#NextEconomy @byron_auguste: Prime aged men and women are dropping out of the labour market
#NextEconomy @byron_auguste: low paid people barely cover the cost of their own employment so that dropping out makes sense
#NextEconomy @byron_auguste: 30-40M college goesr din't graduate; 15-20M caregivers who can't work 10-15M old workers need to reskill
#NextEconomy @byron_auguste: Gallup estimates only 30% of Americans are engaged at work
#NextEconomy @byron_auguste: $150-200 trillion is the rough estimate of human capital in the US - 4-5x the value of US corporate assets
#NextEconomy @byron_auguste: we need to think about human capital as a universal asset - and how to optimise return on human capital
#NextEconomy @byron_auguste: instead of Pedigree - degrees and work history, hire on Mastery - demostrated skill
#NextEconomy @byron_auguste: Training needs to be accessible and asessable so anyone can use ot
#NextEconomy @byron_auguste: techHire has an IT jobs focus opportunity@Work is a TechHire employer network
#NextEconomy @byron_auguste: if you employ people sign up on TEchHire.org
#NextEconomy @byron_auguste: if you teach train or mento, use TechHire to match taining to demand
#NextEconomy @byron_auguste: If you create new technologies work on rewiring the US Labour market
#NextEconomy @laurensmiley: we're now looking at the presnt of work, people organising labour on the ground
#NextEconomy @jess_kutch: there was a barista in starbucks who had to wrok with long sleeves in the heat as SB had a ban on visible tattoos
#NextEconomy @jess_kutch: what started with a few people at starbucks is now 25,000 people worldwide
#NextEconomy @jess_kutch: employees are able to hold their employers accountable by sharing this worker knowledge
#NextEconomy Michelle Miller: right now it is hard for employees to share wiht other employees by coworker.org gives them this 
#NextEconomy Michelle Miller: we want to creat the infrastructure for the new forms of workplace democracy for the 21st century
#NextEconomy Michelle Miller: we want to do this in partnership with the employees and what they know from the frontline
#NextEconomy Michelle Miller: I can't think of a better time to be working on this by putting workers at the centre of this
#NextEconomy @laurensmiley: Liz Shuler has been working on reinventing the labor union for the future
#NextEconomy @lizshuler: we think it is fantastic that workers are finding new ways to organise alongside labor unions
#NextEconomy @lizshuler: AFL-CIO has 13M workes ar all leves of the economy from actors to Nasa scientists and firefighters
#NextEconomy @lizshuler: we are seeing productivity go up and wages stagnate, and we need to work together to do that
#NextEconomy @lizshuler: you don't necessarily have as much leverage as traditional collective bargaining, but social campaigns can work too
#NextEconomy @lizshuler: the labour movement is about worker democracy and how to lift voices in today's economy
#NextEconomy @lizshuler: we have our central council in silicon valley working to help shuttle bus drivers and janitors
#NextEconomy @lizshuler: There is a fear of retaliation from management, as we heard from the Uber driver earlier
#NextEconomy @laurensmiley: is it even possible to attempt to organise a union for on-demand workers?
#NextEconomy @lizshuler: under labor laws it is impossibe to organise aunion for contract workers, but we are seeing people innovating
#NextEconomy @lizshuler: I like to think of the unions as the original disruptors - disrupting the gilded age
#NextEconomy @lizshuler: I can't leave as a labor person without a call to action text WTF to 235246 we are talking about how to help 1099
#NextEconomy @laurensmiley: tell me about Universal Basic Income, Andy
#NextEconomy @AndyStern_DC: I have spent all my life working on workers benefits; I became a union leader by accident
#NextEconomy @AndyStern_DC: Andy Grove said they there are strategic inflection points; thats how we are for work and income now
#NextEconomy @AndyStern_DC: something big needs to happen - Universal Basic Income is that thing
#NextEconomy @AndyStern_DC: every year, every american 18 or older gets a check of $1000/month 
#NextEconomy @AndyStern_DC: this gives everyone the choices that the wealthy have now, to look after themselves, their family
#NextEconomy @AndyStern_DC: giving money for education hasn't worked; directly giving money is simpler and clearer
#NextEconomy @laurensmiley: there is a fight to raise the wage floor is this a cop out?
#NextEconomy @AndyStern_DC: we already have a cop out with EITC and food stamps that Walmart uses to underpay its workers
#NextEconomy @AndyStern_DC: we should not stop jobs being replaced by innovation or robots, just guard against the harm
#NextEconomy @lizshuler: we're thinking about what the future is for an organisation of workers and we will work with other orgs
#NextEconomy @jsmarr: can you use UBI to replace more targetted programs? Is a lump sum better than a negative income tax?
#NextEconomy @AndyStern_DC: the problem wiht a negative income tax is that is based on income
#NextEconomy @AndyStern_DC: welfare programs end up with costly qualifications, look at the Alaska option
#NextEconomy @AndyStern_DC: lets let people make choices, lets get them to choose how to spend their money to do the right thing
#NextEconomy @LauraDTyson: I asked to moderate this session becsaue when I read Nick and Dave's piece I was blown away
#NextEconomy @LauraDTyson: the middle class is under attack - and a threat to the middle class is s threat to growth
#NextEconomy @DavidRolf_SEIU: I'd like to imagine an alternative history of the election of 1976 where they had said we'll create wealth
#NextEconomy @DavidRolf_SEIU: imagine that we will create more wealth in the next 40 years than ever, but 90% will go to the top 1%
#NextEconomy @DavidRolf_SEIU: what nick and I promised in our june article was a secret conspiracy to replace the war on the middle class
#NextEconomy @DavidRolf_SEIU: with a new virtuous cycle that will grow the economy
#NextEconomy @NickHanauer: if you understand the economy, growth is increasing amounts of diverse demand with increasing innovation
#NextEconomy @NickHanauer: if we include people robustly in our economic system that it what creates success
#NextEconomy @NickHanauer: there are no counterexamples to inclusive econbomy as success, exclusive as failure
#NextEconomy @NickHanauer: the article described this http://www.democracyjournal.org/37/shared-security-shared-growth.php?page=all
#NextEconomy @NickHanauer: we need to switch to proration - work an hour for an hours worth of work
#NextEconomy @NickHanauer: and the principle of portability - to move benefits with you not employer 
#NextEconomy @LauraDTyson: different societies handle different kinds of employment differently
#NextEconomy @LauraDTyson: what are the benfits we are talking about? it's not just in current benefits packages
#NextEconomy @DavidRolf_SEIU: America is almost unique in how we assign responsibility to employers, creates incentives to avoid employment
#NextEconomy @DavidRolf_SEIU: the 1950 decision that put the obligations on employers created within a year the franchise system to avoid it
#NextEconomy @NickHanauer: this leads to this crazy race to the bottom where Walmart employs a million workers at poverty wages
#NextEconomy @NickHanauer: Walmart earns $27B each year, they could easily pay their employees far more
#NextEconomy @LauraDTyson: those corporate profit growth came from a growth of productivity that was not passed through to them
#NextEconomy @DavidRolf_SEIU: if a lawyer can figure out how to bill me on 6 minute increments it can be worked out how to get it right
#NextEconomy @NickHanauer: this is a very surmountable problem
#NextEconomy @LauraDTyson: what is the cost of doing this and who pays the cost - is this redistributon?
#NextEconomy @LauraDTyson: how much does it cost and who is going to pay?
#NextEconomy @NickHanauer: it would be incorporated in the economy like any other change in costs
#NextEconomy @NickHanauer: us corporations will spend $700B on stock buyback alone this year - we can not raise the price 1â€¹
#NextEconomy @LauraDTyson: it's a distribution choice
#NextEconomy @LauraDTyson: one reason companies do share buybacks is so companies can finance debt not equity
#NextEconomy @LauraDTyson: if you rasie the price of labour you encourage employers to use less of it
#NextEconomy @DavidRolf_SEIU: when congress proposed banning more than 8 hours a day of labour for children dept stores said would close
#NextEconomy @NickHanauer: jobs will no more shrink when wages go up than animals will shrink when plants grow
#NextEconomy @NickHanauer: the $15 minimum wage came from us as it is halfway between minimum wage tracking inflation and growth
#NextEconomy @LauraDTyson: lets talk about basic income
#NextEconomy @DavidRolf_SEIU: we need a basic income for everyone, we need high wages for work and to decouple benefits from employment
#NextEconomy @DavidRolf_SEIU: what we will remember 100 years from now is whether when the american dream was at risk did we stand up?
#NextEconomy @logangreen: I've been obsessed with transportation for lots of years, since I was down in LA
#NextEconomy @logangreen: for my first job between driving to school and to work in LA I was spending 3 hours a day in traffic
#NextEconomy @logangreen: LA is a city built around cars not people, and all those cars with one person in could be shared
#NextEconomy @logangreen: I then spent all of college wihout a car and worked out how to use public transportation
#NextEconomy @logangreen: I ended up on th epublic transportation board and realised after 3 years I had accomplished nothing
#NextEconomy @logangreen: public transit in the us is a dead end as only 30% of the fare pays for the trip, so there is no engine for growth
#NextEconomy @logangreen: I took a trip through Southern Africa, and I was blown away with how quiet the streets were there
#NextEconomy @logangreen: everyone walked or used combis, which were small bus routes built by individuals who had cars and spotted demand
#NextEconomy @logangreen: so how do we bring this back to the US and build a transportation network that scales unlike public transit
#NextEconomy @logangreen: here everyone has a car - families have multiple cars so there is a lot of supply
#NextEconomy @timoreilly: you did pure peer to peer with zimride and then moved to on demand with Lyft
#NextEconomy @logangreen: I think we can get close to the price of public transit
#NextEconomy @logangreen: in the US we spend about $2 trillion a year on transportation and 95% of that is car ownership
#NextEconomy @logangreen: poepl spend first on houseing, then on transportation then a distant 3rd is spent on food
#NextEconomy @timoreilly: what is the endpoint if people do give up their cars?
#NextEconomy @logangreen: it will be a mix - when it is a dense city it will tend to professional drivers doing end to end trips
#NextEconomy @logangreen: most americans commute 12.5 miles to work each way every day and that id too expensive fro lyft now
#NextEconomy @logangreen: what we want to do is match up the commuters with other possible trips
#NextEconomy @timoreilly: the casual carpool lane on the bay bridge provides an incentive for this - we need more of that
#NextEconomy @timoreilly: how do we deal wiht the drivers doing this full time having a living wage
#NextEconomy @logangreen: in 2014 us and uber were in a price war, and if we hadn't responded we would have had much fewer rides
#NextEconomy @logangreen: as we made those moves we wanted to ensure that the full time drivers were ok
#NextEconomy @logangreen: we gave a power driver bonus for those drivers doing more of the driving to help the people who counted on it 
#NextEconomy @timoreilly: you allow tipping in the app which uber does not
#NextEconomy @timoreilly: since I started doing this event my tipping habits have changed 
#NextEconomy @logangreen: the majority of users do not tip, but a substantial number do and it is material to the drivers
#NextEconomy @timoreilly: you can make it friendlier to drivers by tipping more and making it so
#NextEconomy q: at what point do you negotiate wiht drivers to help getting cheaper vehicles
#NextEconomy @logangreen: as we get to scale we can do more there we partnered wiht Hertz to do a daily/weekly rental to drive for Lyft
#NextEconomy @logangreen: we did a program with Shell to provide discounts on gasoline
#NextEconomy @logangreen: we also announced expresspay where drivers need money to cashout same day once you hit $50
#NextEconomy q: a lot of questions we have about inequality could be answered if we had access to the raw data you have on operations
#NextEconomy @logangreen: we've been doing a few exciting partnerships recently
#NextEconomy @logangreen: a substantial number of lyft rides start or end at transit stops - we are the last mile for public transit
#NextEconomy @logangreen: the least profitable runs fro transit agencies are the empty buses that run around the hills and pick up people
#NextEconomy q: what load factor you'd have to use if there was an employee determination?
#NextEconomy @logangreen: a handful of things that are different between lyft and uber - tipping is in lyft, not in uber
#NextEconomy @logangreen: uber has doen more to require dress code and vehicles and uniformity
#NextEconomy @logangreen: we a;ways want lyft to be 'be yourself' as peers rather than drivers
#NextEconomy @logangreen: we have not received state subsidies but we launched lyftline a year ago that is more like a transit line
#NextEconomy @logangreen: the majority of our rides are now lyftline
#NextEconomy @logangreen: there is scope for employer provided benefits here, which would be better than parking places
#NextEconomy @StevenLevy: Chad Dickerson is the CEO of Etsy, which you all know
#NextEconomy @StevenLevy: You were an English Major - you siad a liberal arts education was more important than science and maths
#NextEconomy @chaddickerson: running a startup is like king lear - dividing up the kingdom is a bit like the cap table
#NextEconomy @chaddickerson: liberal arts teach you how to communicate. we're not building software we are building experiences here
#NextEconomy @StevenLevy: Small is beautiful is something that you embrace - you startwd with artisinal items
#NextEconomy @chaddickerson: Schumachers Small Is Beutiful inspired me - it is a blueprint for an economy of many small decentralsied things
#NextEconomy @chaddickerson: when I think about the web and Etsy, i thikn it helps us realise the human economy can be beautiful
#NextEconomy @chaddickerson: the way that Etsy grows is by connecting more and more of these small things
#NextEconomy @chaddickerson: 1.6M sellers in nearly every country in the world $200M in 2014 last Q $65M
#NextEconomy @chaddickerson: Etsy is based on shared success - Etsy takes 3.5% cut of sales on Etsy - the money largely goes to community
#NextEconomy @chaddickerson: roughly 18% of sellers is that etsy is their full time job, but many value the flexibility of it not being
#NextEconomy @StevenLevy: Is esty the post robot apocalypse?
#NextEconomy @chaddickerson: Etsy is us taking over from the machines rather than vice versa - 3d printing is making inroads
#NextEconomy @StevenLevy: when etsy began it was stuff amde by a single person then you allowed people working for them,
#NextEconomy @chaddickerson: Etsy manufacturing is misunderstood. We noticed that many sellers were telling us that they would get a rush
#NextEconomy @chaddickerson: they were feeling unwelcome on etsy because they needed help but can't fulfil it all themselves
#NextEconomy @chaddickerson: it's a good thing when you get orders but it can be hard to keep up with demands
#NextEconomy @chaddickerson: Alison made superhero capes, and got a lot of demand, ans he asked an apparel factory to help her make them
#NextEconomy @chaddickerson: what we learned from etsy manufacturing for outside production that we vetted - about 5,000 do it
#NextEconomy @chaddickerson: we find that most sellers use local manufacturers for growing their businesses
#NextEconomy @chaddickerson: we are seeing individual sellers registering as manufacturing as well as older family businesses
#NextEconomy @StevenLevy: at what point does the manufacturing project lose meaning?
#NextEconomy @chaddickerson: our sellers, even when they want to scale they want to stay involved in production
#NextEconomy @chaddickerson: my computer bag is scaled up by working with leather workers and craftmanship
#NextEconomy @chaddickerson: it is a smaller more beautiful version of manufacturing
#NextEconomy @StevenLevy: Amazon just launched 'hand made by amazon' does that compete?
#NextEconomy @chaddickerson: we have been doing this for years - we really believe in it and it's not  side project or a test
#NextEconomy @chaddickerson: we have a concept called Etsy Teams who self organise to work together on projects
#NextEconomy @chaddickerson: during the Greek crisis the Etsy team in Italy were asking to buy from the Etsy sellers in Greece
#NextEconomy @chaddickerson: Etsy is a certified B Corp - using the power of business to create social good
#NextEconomy @chaddickerson: The exciting thing about our business is that our whole business is based on shared success
#NextEconomy @StevenLevy: when you are a B Corp what do you do differently?
#NextEconomy @chaddickerson: a third party certifies us that we are meeting social goals as well as business ones
#NextEconomy @DivaDanese: I love etsy - I loved your videos that dignified the act of crafting, DO you plan more like that?
#NextEconomy @chaddickerson: story telling and helping our sellers tell our stories is important too
#NextEconomy @chaddickerson: we really care about the process of making, we can see that in the about pages
#NextEconomy @chaddickerson: in etsy manufacturing you can see the people involved who our sellers are working together with
#NextEconomy @DivaDanese: I used to know a lot fo your technologists and I'm impressed with how you run that bit of the company too
#NextEconomy @chaddickerson: I care about he 'code is craft' mantra that our tech team has adopted
#NextEconomy @zeynepton: I'm goign to talk about how to make low wage jobs better jobs without urting prices or profits
#NextEconomy @zeynepton: in 1913 Ford lowered the cost of production os the average americn could buy a car
#NextEconomy @zeynepton: but this system had a weakness - ebveryone was interchangeable parts
#NextEconomy @zeynepton: then Toyota by design created a human centred system empowering the employees to fix problems
#NextEconomy @zeynepton: Toyota showed the world that the outcome was higher productivity and better quality too
#NextEconomy @zeynepton: toyota became the gold standard and everyone copied them
#NextEconomy @zeynepton: Todat's mass production workers don't work in factories but in retail and food service
#NextEconomy @zeynepton: if you want to make an economy inclusive you ahve to make these jobs better jobs
#NextEconomy @zeynepton: I'm an operations managment professor and I started looking at retail supply chains to optimise inventory
#NextEconomy @zeynepton: we saw retail did a good job at planning but broke down at teh store level
#NextEconomy @zeynepton: we found goods were stuck in stores and retail tells were inaccurate
#NextEconomy @zeynepton: we found so many stores had operational problems with  low staff and high staff turnover
#NextEconomy @zeynepton: what i saw was that retail was operating in a vicious cycle where labour was treated as as cost to minimise
#NextEconomy @zeynepton: then retailer underinvest in workers in wages, in training and in staffing
#NextEconomy @zeynepton: this vicious cycle is bad for the cutomers and the companies as well as the workers
#NextEconomy @zeynepton: Next i staretd working for companies that worked in excellence like mercadona in spain
#NextEconomy @zeynepton: mercadona's employee turnover is 3.8% - I coudln't believe this was so low
#NextEconomy @zeynepton: they provide training, schedules are known one month in advance and staff are happy
#NextEconomy @zeynepton: I ten mmoved to Alabama QuikTrip a chain wiht gasoline and convenience stores
#NextEconomy @zeynepton: QuikTrip has been in fortunes 100 best companies to work fro for years in a row
#NextEconomy @zeynepton: what si their secret? How do they get low prices, good jobs and great performance
#NextEconomy @zeynepton: I wanted it to be higher wages and benefits simply creating higher performance
#NextEconomy @zeynepton: what I found was that they were like Toyota the achieved excellence through human centred Opeating system
#NextEconomy @zeynepton: often you see people in retail whose only job is shelving merchandise
#NextEconomy @zeynepton: in mercadona they will shelve, order products, and open a till if needed - they are empowered to improve
#NextEconomy @zeynepton: they chose to give some slack in the system so employees can do more things
#NextEconomy @zeynepton: mercadona have only around 8000 prodcuts not the 40000 of a typical store
#NextEconomy @zeynepton: thsi system is better for employees and drives operational excellence too
#NextEconomy @zeynepton: for these to work, you need a qualified workforce, so they invest in people
#NextEconomy @zeynepton: right now there are too few operating  Good Job Strategy - that si a way fro companies to compete better
#NextEconomy @zeynepton: this is not easy to pull off - excellence is harder to achieve than mediocrity
#NextEconomy @zeynepton: Worker groups: put pressure on companies that have a good jobs strategy
#NextEconomy @zeynepton: investors: ask companies for data on employee turnover, engagement and activism so they measure them
#NextEconomy @zeynepton: Patty Donovan of QuikTrip said "I work with 12-14 people, and they touch others so they can be happy and succesful"
#NextEconomy @laurensmiley: Dan Teran founded Managed by Q in 2014  - an outsourced office manager
#NextEconomy @laurensmiley: Palak Shah is the social innovations director for the national domestic workers alliance
#NextEconomy @laurensmiley: Dan you built good jobs into operations at managed by Q
#NextEconomy @dpteran: we employ hundreds of cleaners and handymen in NY chicago and SF
#NextEconomy @dpteran: we started out outsourcing to other companies, but realised if we wanted the best employees, be the best emplotr
#NextEconomy @dpteran: we implemented what Zeynep said in her book - cross-training is key
#NextEconomy @dpteran: We had a handyman at IKEA in our uniform who created referrals by good behaviour
#NextEconomy @dpteran: supply side referrals is the hardest part of scaling a business; by employing them and training we encourage this
#NextEconomy @dpteran: we ask how people how likely they are to refer and get an NPS of 83
#NextEconomy @dpteran: they tell us their abilities and where they want tow ork and their home address and we make empathetic schedules
#NextEconomy @dpteran: there is an on demand aspect to the business but there is a massive recurring element which eases scheduling
#NextEconomy @dpteran: we think about on demand as having enough slack in the system to support that on top of scheduled
#NextEconomy @dpteran: we wanted to have super high employee retention, so we wanted people to eb abel to grow and develop in the company
#NextEconomy @dpteran: there is path to progress from an operator to a mentor to a supervisor, and some become account managers or QA engs
#NextEconomy @dpteran: whetehr you work in the office or the field, everyone is an operator, and everyone cleans, even engineers
#NextEconomy @dpteran: this has huge results as the engineers have to actually use the operator app
#NextEconomy @dpteran: the field operators seeing the office employees in the fields makes a difference
#NextEconomy @dpteran: the base benefits offered to managers and software engineers are the same as for the operators too
#NextEconomy @dpteran: every quarter after I present to the board I then present to the operator assembly too
#NextEconomy @dpteran: a lot fo the handymen were lone wolves and then they come in the house and then become part of the team
#NextEconomy @laurensmiley: do you see yourself as a do gooder? will all CEOs want to be like you?
#NextEconomy @dpteran: we're not fighting a battle we are working to do the right thing for the long term fro the company
#NextEconomy @palaknshah: we are the national voice for the domestic workers, cleaners, nannies and so on
#NextEconomy @palaknshah: for years domestic workers have been exempted from most labour protections
#NextEconomy @palaknshah: the emergence of silicon valley into the domestic worker market is changing everything about it
#NextEconomy @palaknshah: what we are also seeing that the gig economy workers are seeing many of the same things that domestic workers do
#NextEconomy @palaknshah: we are realising that there is an opportunity to shape the DNA of this economy
#NextEconomy @palaknshah: we think there is an opportunity to solve for equity
#NextEconomy @palaknshah: we ahve come up with that we call the good work code #goodworkcode
#NextEconomy @palaknshah: there are 8 values: safety; stability & flexibility; transaparency; shared prosperity; a liveable wage;i
#NextEconomy @palaknshah: inclusion & input; support & connection; growth & development; http://www.goodworkcode.org/
#NextEconomy @palaknshah: this is a public leadership case to be made for signing up for this
#NextEconomy Lead Genius CEO: we are keen to sign on to this and show good work practices and share these
#NextEconomy @palaknshah: change doesn't happen overnight, it takes time. These 12 companies are taking the first step and we will learn
#NextEconomy @palaknshah: given all the business challenges we have heard about today, this will start to give ideas fro good work
#NextEconomy @palaknshah: we are talking to lost of different companies - we hear excitement from a business and leadership point of view
#NextEconomy @timoreilly: Evan's 1st job was working for O'Relly Media years ago. First Blogger then Twitter and now Medium show his vision
#NextEconomy @timoreilly: it means caring deeply about what you want to see int he world and then working to make it so
#NextEconomy @timoreilly: there's through line in blogger twitter adn medium about who we out to be
#NextEconomy @ev: The thing that got me excited about the interenet was the idea of knowledge exchange
#NextEconomy @ev: I grew up on a farm in nebraska pre-internet and the idea of tapping into the worlds brains was the most exciting thing
#NextEconomy @ev: a lot fo people had he idea that putting thoughts out was what the internet did and lowering that barrier
#NextEconomy @ev: in 2012 it seemd like the barrier was low enough but we needed to build more on top of it
#NextEconomy @ev: all teh problems that we see in the landscape today were caused by that same force
#NextEconomy @timoreilly: on medium when you get a good debate going that is when it works very well - it's a good place for facts
#NextEconomy @timoreilly: this is very difference from the discourse we see in politics. How do we do this more
#NextEconomy @ev: I'm optimisic now as this was the core idea of the internet - it is intentional to design on medium that we are the same
#NextEconomy @ev: on medium we are all on the same playing fields and at the same level - 
#NextEconomy @timoreilly: every comment is effectively a new article on the smae level
#NextEconomy @ev: there are many times on medium where you can respond to an article with a reasoned reply
#NextEconomy @ev: most of he campaigns are now publishing on medium and senators are posting on medium about the iran deal
#NextEconomy @ev: on the internet what you measure gets rewarded- unique visitors and page views
#NextEconomy @ev: we make distinction between a 1 second view and a 1 minute read
#NextEconomy @ev: time isn't the ideal metric, what we really want to know did it change someone's mind
#NextEconomy @timoreilly: it struck me along time ago what did the good life look like in a world without drudgery
#NextEconomy @timoreilly: I look like to Plato's symposium and debating the good life - I see that is what we are doing on medium
#NextEconomy @timoreilly: the jobless future could look liek medium
#NextEconomy @ev: an early medium post on dinovember where this couple convinced their kids that plastic dinosaurs came alive
#NextEconomy @ev: this was a funny story that people wrote and others found it funny
#NextEconomy @timoreilly: that fundamental accessibilty of media does make a dfifference
#NextEconomy @timoreilly: when will people think this internet stuff is art
#NextEconomy @ev: you can say it has gone the opposite way - social media lowered the barrier for publsihing
#NextEconomy @ev: but it also lowered the ceiling od what was possible by limiting options
#NextEconomy @ev: if you look at facebook it is commercial publishers and the users share to freidns and comment
#NextEconomy @timoreilly: so medium is relatively highbrow
#NextEconomy @ev: there si going to be professional journalism there, and we will have ways for people to pay fro it
#NextEconomy @ev: we would like to get to scale and build these toolsl and let people see what makes sense for them
#NextEconomy @ev: obvious ventures was a venture fund I started last year with a couple of partners
#NextEconomy @ev: our focus is what we call world-positive investing 
#NextEconomy @ev: my approach to investing is always I want to make more good things happen in the world wiht money
#NextEconomy @ev: if it's something I want to exist in the world, that is my filter
#NextEconomy @ev: can we make an intellectually honest argument that at scale this can make a positive impact to the world
#NextEconomy @ev: we invested in Diamond Foundry that is creating diamonds in a Fab, no mining no slavery
#NextEconomy @ev: a company called beyond meat that is veggie based protein
#NextEconomy q: how do you think about the future?
#NextEconomy @ev: I just listen to Tim,
#NextEconomy @timoreilly: I think about the future through big long-term trends adn look for people who are passionate about what they do
#NextEconomy @ev: one way I think about the future is that technology is neutral and removes gaps and friction and costs
#NextEconomy @ev: the internet is a giant convenience store for human desire, and it can run amok
#NextEconomy @ev: the  companies tat tend to succeed are those that make things easier and more convenient
#NextEconomy @ev: that there are cheap calories on very corner doesn't eliminate the possibility of a great farm to table resturant
#NextEconomy q: can you talk around the broader movement around communication at medium spillover
#NextEconomy @ev: there are similar trends for lots of things - marketplaces for consumers and producers
#NextEconomy q: what is the most important lesson learned at intersection of internet and comms?
#NextEconomy @ev: it's always hard to build things
#NextEconomy @ev: in 1997 I was really cocky and I put a copy of this book 'focus' on Tims desk
#NextEconomy @ev: I use this Tim quote "business is a context for doing interesting things"
#NextEconomy q: what has been better for you using your own products?
#NextEconomy @ev: I enjoy using my own prodcuts though I often cringe as theya re not good enough yet
#NextEconomy @ev: I always think about 'who do you want your customers to become'
#NextEconomy @ev: twitter I think of a superpower in their pocket that tells them what is going on
#NextEconomy @ev: with medium i think it is there to make me smarter by telling better stories
#NextEconomy @ev: I write on medium ebcasue I weant to be aprt of a conversation adn effect how other people think
#NextEconomy @timoreilly: an event like this is my medium, so to speak - we are engaged in a conversation we want to continue
#NextEconomy @laurensmiley: we have a vertical on medium called #wtfeconomy so follow that and respond there
#NextEconomy @StevenLevy: I would like to applaud the audience too
#NextEconomy @timoreilly: I want this to be the start of not just further conversation but of action - we hope to see you back next year
#NextEconomy @timoreilly: lets go and make good things happen in the world!
