#indieweb @dissolve333: I added indiewebcamp.com/vouch support to https://ben.thatmustbe.me/new by indexing my referrers
#indieweb @aaronpk: I have a webpage with a webmention endpoint which gives a form when you fetch it from a browser
#indieweb @aaronpk: when I get a webmention it goes through the approve() function and checks if I have linked to you before
#indieweb @aaronpk: if I send a webmention from a non approved domain it sends a 449 code instead
#indieweb @t: I added  to my indiecomms page of contact info it shows facetime on iOS/MacOS but not on android
#indieweb @t: I also added the "add to homescreen" prompting animation to my tantek.com/contacts.html page
#indieweb @dissolve333: I made a business card that has my h-card markup on the back
#indieweb @obra: I have been importing my tweets into Known today
#indieweb @obra: the @twitter export drops timestamps for tweets before 2010
#indieweb @obra: I parse the json from the twitter export and post them to known in backwards order for each month
#indieweb @obra: I use the new "nomention" feature @benwerd added to the API so I don't send 7 years of webmentions on import
#indieweb @obra: Known was timing out trying to get the webmention endpoint for Dopplr as the site is dead
#indieweb @rascul3: I got my sister set up with a Known site at jessielikes.coffee
#indieweb @rascul3: I also set up brid.gy so she gets her twitter likes POSSEd back too
#indieweb @benwerd: Known now works on PHP 5.3 because lots of hosting only has that
#indieweb @benwerd: I rewrote the db backend and the indieauth/micropib plugin
#indieweb @benwerd: I added a following UI to Known that gets other people's posts in microformats
#indieweb @benwerd: I can also follow non-microformats sites too eg Anil Dash
#indieweb @benwerd: I need to add back the response and like buttons so I can read the whole web on my site
#indieweb @sandhawke: I have been extracting my old livejournal posts and posting them on my own site
#indieweb @sandhawke: I wrote the import code in Go - on github there was code that downloaded xml for my LJ posts
#indieweb @sandhawke: I made each of my posts correspond to an ID in livejournal and mirrored replies too
#indieweb @aaronpk: I was making a new micropub app Teacup based on Quill https://quill.p3k.io
#indieweb @aaronpk: teacup is for tracking your drinks - it lets you choose what you are drinking now and post it
#indieweb @aaronpk: it also does browser geolocation and has an "add to homescreen" button
#indieweb @aaronpk: the app is at https://teacup.p3k.io and once you click the button it take you to the post
#indieweb @aaronpk: if your site does not support micropub, the post are on teacup, not on your site
#indieweb @aaronpk: If you login with a non-micropub site you get a profile on teacup, otherwise it links to your posts
#indieweb @aaronpk: I also made this work on my pebble watch which is why it has buttons not type-in
#indieweb @aaronpk: I'm making an indieweb-friendly silo, which is a big goal here
#indieweb @mlncn: my site is in Drupal5 - I used to post there and send out to twitter and facebook
#indieweb @mlncn: I want to push from a Known homebase to Drupal website the way you can to twitter
#indieweb @mlncn: I would like to get Kkown to post to more than one twitter/fb/drupal site too as well
#indieweb @mlncn: I want to get Known to do everything that Buffer does but better
#indieweb @mlncn: posting from Known to a Drupal 8 site first, then working on making Drupal do what Known does
#indieweb @obra: I have a twitter client on my phone and tend to reply to tweets there instead
#indieweb @obra: I have an android Share hook to send to known, which also publishes to twitter
#indieweb @obra: this is a tiny Cordova app that uses the android share intent, and launches my known website with the share reply page
#indieweb @obra: and here is the reply sent by my phone: https://twitter.com/obra/status/521422682882314240
#indieweb @benwerd: how quickly can I get this on my phone? it will save me 3 hours a day
#indieweb @obra: now making a build for @benwerd - the app is called Known -I'll have to talk to @withknown about licencing
#indieweb @pdurbin: I have made a proof of concept Firefox micropub client
#indieweb @0xdaf: I have made a proof of concept Firefox micropub client
#indieweb @t: we have sketched out the vouch flow now at http://indiewebcamp.com/vouch
#indieweb @t: because we have a growing adoption of indieweb sites and webmention, it is now a spam target
#indieweb @t: the way it works is that if the webmention is not form an approved url, it sends a vouch url that connects you to the host
#indieweb @t: if we want a vouch url we return http error 449 which msft made up which means "add a parameter"
