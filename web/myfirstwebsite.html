<p>The first packets sent on what was to become the Internet happened 45 years ago <a href="http://www.sri.com/work/timeline-innovation/timeline.php?timeline=computing-digital#!&innovation=arpanet">today</a>:
<blockquote> The very first transmission on the ARPANET, on October 29, 1969, was the logon from UCLA to SRI.</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">first website</a> was posted earlier, but the w3c was founded 20 years ago today too., and there is a <a href="http://www.w3.org/20/">gala celebration</a> this afternoon.
<p>This made me think about my first website, so I went looking in the Internet Archive (which was <a href="archive.org/v2">redesigned</a> for the first time in years today too).
I found the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19970220031543/http://www.mmcorp.com/">company website for MultiMedia Corporation</a> from 1997 - note the stylish design by Nikki Barton, 
the trendy monospaced text and the manually constructed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19970220031543/http://www.mmcorp.com/">company news blog</a>.
<p>However, hidden away were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19970605021938/http://www.mmcorp.com/mmcsite/company/personal.html">staff homepages</a> - under tilde as recently revived by <a href="http://tilde.club">tilde.club</a>, and in there is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19970605014347/http://www.mmcorp.com/~kevin/">my first webpage</a>:
<p><iframe src="firsthomepage.html" width=640px height=1400px ></iframe>
<p>Now archived <a href="firsthomepage.html">here too.</a> 
<p>I put this up sometime after <a href="http://andrewmarks.media">Andrew's</a> birth in April 1995, before <a href="http://christophermarks.me">Christopher's</a> in December 1996, and never did update it, despite the promise there.
<p>What was your first website?
