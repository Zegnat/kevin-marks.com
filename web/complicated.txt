#itscomplicated @zephoria: when I was at Berkman I got involved with the Internet Safety Taskforce, we had to fend off the US Attorneys General
#itscomplicated @zephoria: each chapter fo my book responds to a different panic point
#itscomplicated @zephoria: You can buy my book "It's Complicated" http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0300166311?ie=UTF8&camp=213733&creative=393185&creativeASIN=0300166311&linkCode=shr&tag=epeusepigone-20 but it's all up online for students too
#itscomplicated @zephoria: Starting in the late 1970s we began 24-7 news, and parents were shown stories that made them fear for their kids
#itscomplicated @zephoria: the 1980s pulled kids indoors more, which gave rise to the Latchkey Kid phenomenon
#itscomplicated @zephoria: as a latchkey kid you'd get home (see friends) have a healthy snack (Lucky Charms) and do homework (Watch TV)
#itscomplicated @zephoria: to reassure parents, instead the kids ended up in structured activities all the time, from school to bed
#itscomplicated @zephoria: suburbanization and school choice meant that you were more spread out - you couldn't bike to friends
#itscomplicated @zephoria: there was also a fear of school buses - everyone would go on the bus and hang out before and after school
#itscomplicated @zephoria: now school buses are down to 30% and walking has collapsed too, so most kids are driven to school by parents
#itscomplicated @zephoria: the places young people could hang out got curtailed; malls banned teens, and they had no part time jobs, no cash
#itscomplicated @zephoria: with the low wage jobs teens used to do going to older people, they are more dependent on parents for money
#itscomplicated @zephoria: it's also a collective action problem - even if you can get out, have money, your friends don't
#itscomplicated @zephoria: you used to be able to drive at 16, but now most states won't let you drive friends at that age, so no point
#itscomplicated @zephoria: all these changes coincided with the rise of social networks, so the teens moved their public life online
#itscomplicated @zephoria: young people want to be *in* public, but not *be* public - not seen by everyone
#itscomplicated @zephoria: I'm goign to tell you about technical and social approaches to privacy in the face of parents
#itscomplicated @zephoria: I met a girl in DC who would keep getting drama dredged up, so she deleted all her facebook stuff each day
#itscomplicated @zephoria: I asked her if people could keep it anyway, and she said yes, but that would mean they were being a freak
#itscomplicated @zephoria: snapchat isn't for teens to share inappropriate content - thats what 20somethings and politicians use it for
#itscomplicated @zephoria: teens use it where they don't care about persistence - I won't even care about that donut after 10 seconds
#itscomplicated @zephoria: with snapchat, teens have to pay attention, but only for 7 seconds, so they choose when to do it
#itscomplicated @zephoria: michaela was a word of the state, in foster care so her case worker would look at everything on line
#itscomplicated @zephoria: so Michaela tried to delete facebook, but they give a huge guilt trip when you try
#itscomplicated @zephoria: so Michaela would deactivate facebook each time she logged off, then reactivate the next day so she had control
#itscomplicated @zephoria: teens ahve learned to encode their content- I could make sense of myspace, but couldn't decode facebook codes
#itscomplicated @zephoria: teens assume surveillance is part of their world - by parents, teachers or classmates so they encode on FB
#itscomplicated @zephoria: schools lock down social, but not gmail, so kids use gmail during the day tho' wouldn't be seen on it at night
#itscomplicated @zephoria: teens would put brands all over their posts "lets hang out, Nike" so FB would promote them in the feed
#itscomplicated @zephoria: Big Data analysts make me laugh. Coca cola were popular on facebook, and proud. Young people meant the other Coke
#itscomplicated @zephoria: Teens are already living in a world where they assume surveillance, govt is just an extension of parents, schools
#itscomplicated @zephoria: As I look at teens engagement with technology, I see them doing what they always did in a new environment
#itscomplicated @zephoria: Think about the ways that you can make certain that young people are OK. Use the technology to check in
#itscomplicated @zephoria: Jane Jacobs was an amazing urban theorist who said we needed eyes on the street. not cops, but all of us
#itscomplicated @zephoria: as we've got obsessed with technology we forget the world around us, we need to put our eyes on digital streets 
#itscomplicated @zephoria: life stages makes a big difference to how people use the same technology
#itscomplicated @zephoria: for teenagers now, Facebook is not a place for them as it is full of their parents hanging out with their besties
#itscomplicated @zephoria: teens used to change their IDs as they matured but that got harder, so instead they change modalities
#itscomplicated @zephoria: we tend to pay attention to how the privileged classes use tech, but they are bifurcated here too
#itscomplicated @zephoria: teens look at what they can gain from tech, but those with more privilege think about what they have to lose
#itscomplicated @zephoria: the thing I struggle with the most is how you move a collective action problem
#itscomplicated @zephoria: there's a great film out called Teenage, which is about the social construction of the teenager
#itscomplicated @zephoria: we created compulsory highschool in the 1950s as a jail system to keep the teens out of the workforce
#itscomplicated @zephoria: this age segregation shaped American society - we now use "brain science" to justify teens not making decisions
#itscomplicated @zephoria: we're creating compulsory Higher Education now in response to another labour market crisis
#itscomplicated @zephoria: there is an academic fetishization of what is new and hot No more big data studies based on twitter please!
#itscomplicated @zephoria: I made the foolish mistake of analyzing the tensions between MySpace and Facebook in 2006
#itscomplicated @zephoria: the media narrative was obsessed with facebook and trashing MySpace, but used by a poorer demographic
#itscomplicated @zephoria: I realised we were constructing a narrative of myspace as urban and dirty and ghetto - marginalised people
