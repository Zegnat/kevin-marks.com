<p>there is a surplus of low skilled workers in advanced economies - the returns to education are very high
<p>if you take 15 indices of gender parity and look at it for work, it is $28 trillion of additional global GDP
<p>If every country did as well as the best country in its region, that would add $12 Trillion to global GDP
<p>60-70% of people are no longer advancing in market income, ~30% in disposable income
<p>wholesale automation of jobs is unlikely, but 30% of tasks in 60% of jobs will be automated
<p>when ATMs happened, bank tellers jobs didn't go away, but the tasks they did changed
<p>we need to move from thinking about Jobs to Work and from Wages to Income
<p>instead of rejecting these new modes of work, we need to make them work better

<p>Narrative Science analyses data and generates a story as structure, then we turn that into language
<p>if the data and analysis have meaning we can transform that into language
<p>while we would like to have abolished the whole profession of journalism, we went a differnt way
<p>what if we could write one story for every person instead of one read by thousands
<p>we can generate a story for the owner of a restaurant based on the credit card statement
<p>taking a real-time data stream from IOT sensors and providing a story about it is key
<p>if anyone has the word analyst in their job title, something like our Quill will work with them
<p>running algorithms against data gets new meaning, but if the meaning is there is can be transformed into language

<p>they legalised crowd funded small investing recently, but Kickstarter is not going near that 
<p>at some point in the last 15 years it became OK to sell out. Don't Sell Out.

<p>Kickstarter became a Public Benefit Corporation - optimising for benefiting society, not shareholder value

<p>wouldn't it be nice to ask if anyone nearby could pick up the dogfood and drop it off
<p>in 2008 the iphone had just come out, and facebook was only just getting out of colleges
<p>location data was not being used then. I came up with this idea as 'service networking' not 'social networking'
<p>when I launched taskrabbit in Boston Iived in Charlestown and I thought I'd get lots of college students
<p>I recruited 600 moms in chralesetown for the beta network; I thought i'd get students as taskers
<p>I din't get students, I got moms who were out and about, and retirees, and young professionals at weekends
<p>out of the 30,000 taskers the top 10% is doing it full time - 3 tasks a day, ~$7k a month the rest are casual
<p>a lot fo the most successful taskers are handymen or housecleaners who had a  background in that industry
<p>we have been in the market 5 years - when we started there was just craigslist
<p>after 5 years we saw the landscape shift - a lot of companies were specialising in differnt things
<p>we stepped back and said 'what if we were launching now?' and rebuilt in 2014 to focus on mobile, scheduling
<p>in the previous product there was an auction bidding model that would take 24 hours to resolve like ebay
<p>now we can schedule it more practically in advance - the taskers set their rates and availability & show up at once
<p>the great thing about this new platform is that taskers are making more money as they set their rates not bidding
<p>we tested this in London first before rolling out in US and taskers made 400% more monthly

<p>this is a transformation that has been going on slowly for the last 20 years or so where you get more access to info
<p>It was always a fact that howard street was 1-way in that direction, but now I can see that by pinch zooming
<p>we don't even notice how much more powerful we are as signal processors as human beings over the last few years

<p>we get about 15-20,000 tweets a month and they are all fed into the tweets channel
<p>anyone in the company can look at them, before only support people woudl see that
<p>we also make it a rule that everyone in the company has to do support too

<p>at 8 people everyone knows everyone else really well; the amount of communication doesn't scale up
<p>we were 80% public when we were 8 people and at 100 people and it's now 70% private
<p>the challenge is that if all of it were public peopl would ahve to read too much
<p>there is value for a question to be asked and answered in public, but people can be hesitant about it
<p>we can give advice to people administering slacks,

<p>in fact we find most people we see have 3 sources of income, and this doesn't match regulaion
<p>today if you're self employed and have 3 sources of income it is hard to know how much money you have
<p>QuickBooks self-employed lets you say which belongs to personal or business expenses
<p>when you're working for Uber, Lyft etc you are actually a small business, and we can file your business taxes
<p>The government requires paper copies of receipts as a business now
<p>our model at intuit is to find the biggest unsolved pain and solve it - tracking business vs personal was that

<p>in this society the fastest way to be devalued is when asked 'what do you do?' to say that you are a carer
<p>if you don't take care of your families or your workers you are paying an economic price too
<p>we are now below Japan comapred to the fraction of women in the workforce
<p>now daycare costs more than rent in almost all states so people stay home instead
<p>we pay people who care for our children the same as we pay people to park our cars that is incredible
<p>For parents and families the on-demand economy is a godsend. Care is unpredictable
<p>one ear infection can destroy a weeks worth of meetings
<p>when you can schedule your own work that is a solution to the care problem
<p>my son drew me as a laptop, not a person in a laptop, and my husband cooking.
<p>even if companies offer parental leave but the senior men don't take it, it doesn't make a difference
<p>in my foreign policy life, we see large groups of unemployed young people as the ingredients of revolution
<p>loss of family life leads to political turbulence and dysfunction, so we need to support it
<p>tomorrow the 'good work code' is rolling out 
<p>these are work issues, family issues, middle class issues, not just women's issues

<p>by day I'm a feminist, by day I'm the worried mother of 2 boys - "when did girls get smarter than boys?"
<p>looking globally women are the vastly untapped resource
<p>in America women go into the workforce and do well until they are sideswiped by the caring issue
<p>we have a whole debate about short-termism and how it hurts the long term bottom line
<p>I think we are going to have to make legal changes to fix the tension between employment and caring
<p>the ability to live at home and be supported at home connected to a network of caregivers is going to be key
