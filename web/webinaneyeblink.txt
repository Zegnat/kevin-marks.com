#longnow @textfiles: this talk is called "the web in an eye blink" but it is about people and the web
#longnow @textfiles: I give talks, I collect things; a lot of what I do is gain attention - if my clothing hadn't shown that already
#longnow @textfiles: I was very affected by a speech by Wilson Miner wilsonminer.com - he built a tool onstage that everyone wanted
#longnow @textfiles: a talk is not a piece of paper that you drags your finger across for an hour, but a series of strings you can pull on
#longnow @textfiles: Always wear a Viking hat when you visit Iceland - the locals love it
#longnow @textfiles: I have a famous cat called @sockington who has 4.5M twitter followers - it revealed how arbitrary fame it to me
#longnow @textfiles: It was talking to someone from the Today show who wanted me to sedate my cat and fly to NY that made me realise
#longnow @textfiles: Garfield joined twitter but only had 200,000 followers and @sockington welcomed him like Keith Richards talking to Bieber
#longnow @textfiles: when I was about 9, my mother woke me up and said my father was dangerous and we had to leave
#longnow @textfiles: My mother said "grab what you need" and I took my dog and my blanket
#longnow @textfiles: I learned some important lessons: Nothing is permanant; you are responsible for your destiny
#longnow @textfiles: when you make your dad pull over so you can pose with the Apple sign — in sunglasses
#longnow @textfiles: once humans get their hands on things they make the things come alive - even if it is a BBS
#longnow @textfiles: A bullitin board was bascially a computer with a modem and a lonely person attached to it
#longnow @textfiles: young Jason would back up everything he had found on bulletin boards and back them up on floppy discs
#longnow @textfiles: when bulletin boards stopped bing important in my life. No, when they stopped being something I did daily…
#longnow @textfiles: when the web came along. I realised that BBS were persona non grata on the internet
#longnow @textfiles: so I grabbed textfiles.com and put up 30,000 files. Then everyone sent me the stuff that they had stashed 
#longnow @textfiles: I am an accidental historian. I graduated from High School with a 1.7 GPA —that's hard to do without shooting up school
#longnow @textfiles: I graduated Emerson College with a 2.1 GPA - it turns out you cna sneak your way in the back way to respectability
#longnow @textfiles: I am old enough that when I brought a laptop to school and they assumed I was cheating
#longnow @textfiles: my title is "Free Range Archivist" at the Internet Archive- i sound like  a FPS final boss
#longnow @textfiles: the day I tried to download the Internet Archive, it was like a hamster trying to chew a baseball
#longnow @textfiles: the Internet Archive is an amazing collection of human culture in so many different forms
#longnow @textfiles: I have personally overseen or uploaded about 2% of the Internet Archive
#longnow @textfiles: if the Internet Archive being in a church isn't weird enough it is full of tiny statues of people
#longnow @textfiles: If you're at the Internet Archive for 3 years, they make  a statue of you. I love that they did that
#longnow @textfiles: the Internet Archive is the example of a guy who got really rich and didn't turn into a shit (@brewsterkahle)
#longnow @textfiles: I can't overstate how much of our history would not exist without the Internet Archive
#longnow @textfiles: for a lot of people the Internet Archive was the web
#longnow @textfiles: before San Francisco was a tech-bro soup that solved the problem of bro's driving each other everywhere, it was the web
#longnow @textfiles: the web - people will normally think of the time where we learnt to use browsers as the web
#longnow @textfiles: back in 1992 the web was  couple of hundred sites
#longnow @textfiles: the web is ridiculous; it is a fast talker. it can snow you; it's unendingly bored; it gets excited when you buy things
#longnow @textfiles: today @medium said that they found a point between a tweet and longform. It was like being sold a donut. it's a blog
#longnow @textfiles: pizza hut was the very first ecommerce site on the net - they'd ask your address and phone number and call you back
#longnow @textfiles: when geocities died a lot of people said "good riddance" - but it was a lot of people making things for free
#longnow @textfiles: for some people geocities was the largest audience their genetic line had ever reached
#longnow @textfiles: when geocities went down I was very angry. this is their cage - it held 9TB
#longnow @textfiles: At the time of it's death, geocities had no-one assigned to it and was he 212th site on the net
#longnow @textfiles: the web was never really designed to be permenant  -a URL was not built to be forever. It's time to redo that
#longnow @textfiles: Archive Team is a group of guerrilla archivists who rush and take copies before things go down
#longnow @textfiles: today @google said @blogger would take down any nudity that did not have artistic merit by march 15th
#longnow @textfiles: tuens out google is an archive like a supermarket is a food museum
#longnow @textfiles: if we see too many errors on a website, we go grab a copy, jst to be sure
#longnow @textfiles: we pull in about 400GB a day just to be sure in case some guy has it wrong
#longnow @textfiles: life is a lossy format - we do not have enough capacity to store everything
#longnow @textfiles: 
#longnow @textfiles: we don't know what is important. if it's easy to take snapshot that will go away later, lets do it
#longnow @textfiles: my uncle wore long sleeves, because he had a number tattooed on his arm, but he climbed a fence and got away
#longnow @textfiles: when I got into a screaming phone battle with one of the founders of ello— just in case, as I didn't get to do it to FB
#longnow @textfiles: turns out nobody cared about ello so it can go die
#longnow @textfiles: I hate being the gatekeeper - deciding what gets to live and die
#longnow @textfiles: time capsules are a very odd thing - why put things in concrete for others to see after you die
#longnow @textfiles: my definition of the Long Now foundation is us going da dada dah dah and in 1000 years they go "dah da"
#longnow @textfiles: this is us now::we have things that fy in the sky that kill people;things in our pocket that tell us who to sex with
#longnow @textfiles: a school in minnesota put a cornerstone with a time capsule in and they dig it up in10 years, and it is full of water
#longnow @textfiles: this guy is slug - he creeated SpaceWar - if you go to the Computer History Museum he will kick your ass at SpaceWar
#longnow @textfiles: there is a thing I've been working on for 3 years - how do we handle software
#longnow @textfiles: we managed the web, we managed books and music and even video, but software is harder
#longnow @textfiles: we got this smurf game from colecovision running in the browser that was a revelation
#longnow @textfiles: what is the thing that runs code in the browser that wasn't destroyed by Larry Ellison? Javascript
#longnow @textfiles: we have all these old games running on MESS in the browser in javascript
#longnow @textfiles: we now have the emularity - we run Windows in a browser running PPP connecting to the net using Netscape 
#longnow @textfiles: the most important thing - we put up 25,000 software packages, but everyone plays Oregon Trail
#longnow @textfiles: it's less about the tool - which is amazing - but that I grew up through tragedy to build dreams of these children
#longnow @textfiles: that is what is important to me - that a kid in school can use a computer from this year to play a program 20 years old
#longnow @textfiles: nothing is permanent, but love it while it is here. You are responsible for your destiny, but your destiny is shared
#longnow @textfiles: don't walk down the streets of Belfast as the black angel of death - I've done it
#longnow @textfiles: we are the temporary caretakers of this chain of memory so we should look after it
