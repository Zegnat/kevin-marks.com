<h2>Stellar: Building a Common Financial Platform</h2>
<p><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://stellar.org'>joyce kim</a>:  <blockquote><p>47% of the million people who signed up for Stellar had not used digital currency before so we created 500K users
<p>developing world countries like the Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam were huge sign-ups for Stellar
<p>we had a huge take-off in Vietnam before we had translated our site because 1 local tech celeb translated it for us
<p>we have the thesis that money is culture - it is different in the US, Asia and europe. we took off worldwide
<p>in Indonesia <15% of the population have credit cards: we found arbitrage of pre-paid top-ups online through Stellar
<p>We're seeing a lot of people building to stellar in the developing world as we have more users in their country
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://gregbrockman.com'>Greg Brockman</a>:  <blockquote><p>90% of the work of building something is little grungy details that you don't want to hear about
<p>the world is a chaotic system and it is not clear how it will respond to things - say what you're doing and execute
<p>bitcoin has been this iterated process over many years to get people used to it. Stellar addresses its shortcomings
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.commercevc.com'>Dan Rosen</a>:  <blockquote><p>every panel about cryptocurrencies we ask about mainstream adoption - where are we?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://gregbrockman.com'>Greg Brockman</a>:  <blockquote><p>we're still a couple of hops off mainstream adoption - there's always hobbyists first
<p>we have yet to show that cryptocurrency makes people's lives better - which feature matters?
<p>there is also the problem of trust - cryptography doesn't solve the trust problems
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://stellar.org'>joyce kim</a>:  <blockquote><p>we're really far off - the biggest problems are access and user experienceâ€”my friends think it's a crazy tech thing
<p>when it become the backend and they don't have to think about ti to transact with it, then we'll have made it work
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.commercevc.com'>Dan Rosen</a>:  <blockquote><p>excluding Stellar and Stripe, which company has the most potential to affect the future of money
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='https://www.stellar.org/about/'>Jed McCaleb</a>:  <blockquote><p>some cryptocurrency we haven't heard of yet will likely have the impace
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://gregbrockman.com'>Greg Brockman</a>:  <blockquote><p>The US government or other world governments could make cryptocurrency stop dead or take off
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://stellar.org'>joyce kim</a>:  <blockquote><p>telco's - we see them acting as the other bank - they're in a different regulatory world than banks
<p>In tanzania the govt mandated interoperability between different mobile payment companies - that is key
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://stellar.org'>Jed McCaleb</a>:  <blockquote><p>you can monitor a a bitcoin address for receiving, but stellar is easier
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://stellar.org'>joyce kim</a>:  <blockquote><p>stellar as a currency should not be as significant as bitcoin because people transact in their own currency mostly
<p>our board is 3: <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/collision">@collision</a>, Jed McCaleb and <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/rabois">@rabois</a> - we're expanding to 5
<p>Stripe's role is the same as every other important advisor - no specific veto
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://gregbrockman.com'>Greg Brockman</a>:  <blockquote><p>we gave $3m for 2% of the stellars - we'll auction off half our stake to other companies to spread this out
<p>the $10 in stellar per user for 1 million users - the value comes from the people on the exchanges trading
<p>a lot of people with bitcoin are trading them into stellar so we see value defined by that
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://stellar.org'>Jed McCaleb</a>:  <blockquote><p>we're not being a payment provider but a common language for payment providers to use
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://stellar.org'>joyce kim</a>:  <blockquote><p>there is always a sender and a receiver in any given market so we will work through those in each country
<p>I'm fascinated with healthcare - most people on < $2/day are temporarily there because of illness
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://gregbrockman.com'>Greg Brockman</a>:  <blockquote><p>if a govt got behind a cryptocurrency - the question would be how they interoperated, which is odd today already
<p>in order to get this more valuable than what we have today, we need cross-border operation. Stellar is the layer
<p>countries could make a cryptocurrency successful in their region by law, but interoperation is still key
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://stellar.org'>joyce kim</a>:  <blockquote><p>if they make their own currency it could run on stellar as it is currency agnostic. A protocol could translate
<p></blockquote>
<h2>Visions of the Future of Money</h2>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://usat.ly/MgnVZT'>johnshinal</a>:  <blockquote><p>what investments are most exciting right now in money?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://about.me/billtai'>Bill Tai</a>:  <blockquote><p>I'm excited about a mining company called BitFury: they started as an open source community and migrated to silicon
<p>BitFury have proprietary silicon designed perfectly for bitcoin and experience in efficient data centres
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@nshalek'>Nick Shalek</a>:  <blockquote><p>we invest in lending and personal finance, accounting and insurance built. I see Coinbase as an example in Bitcoin
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://panteracapital.com'>Dan Morehead</a>:  <blockquote><p>Bitcoin isn't a category killer it's a serial killer- it ca do so many things - we invested in ChangeTip
<p>Bitcoin is fantastic for very small transactions and <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/changetip">@changetip</a> is a way to do this easily
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@nshalek'>Nick Shalek</a>:  <blockquote><p>the last 20 years of innovation in financial servcies have been slow compared to eg media - bitcoin triggers more
<p>there has been more innovation on top of bitcoin in the last 2 years than there has in banking in 20 years
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://panteracapital.com'>Dan Morehead</a>:  <blockquote><p>blockstream and sidechains are important innovations - altcoins a way to test compared to bitcoin conservatism
<p>bitcoin is likely to win out over altcoins because of the network effect
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://about.me/billtai'>Bill Tai</a>:  <blockquote><p>I follow communities rather than technologies, and the Bitcoin community has developed further than the others
<p>BitFury has evolved to one of the worlds largest transaction processing engines, not just in bitcoins
<p>the features of the blockchain that allow services to be built on top of the protocol still need the infrastructure
<p>Bitfury building operations at scale that run on hydro electricity gives an advantage, and bitcoin mining is mature
<p>a lot fo otehr mining companies are making money by taking cash and selling machines, not mining directly
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://usat.ly/MgnVZT'>johnshinal</a>:  <blockquote><p>you mentioned community - this only works if a lot more people start using cryptocurrencies what about Stellar?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@nshalek'>Nick Shalek</a>:  <blockquote><p>it doesn't need to be stellar versus bitcoin: there are several trillion to be solved in financial services
<p>the competition is not to create the most efficeint technology, but the one with the most users
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://panteracapital.com'>Dan Morehead</a>:  <blockquote><p>we have a foot in both camps - we invested in Ripple and partnered with Caleb of Stellar
<p>they are providing a payments layer that is independent of payment processor
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@nshalek'>Nick Shalek</a>:  <blockquote><p>it's easy to mock mining, but it has worked very well so far: there are unknown unknowns, but this has been robust
<p>efficiency can be solved at a higher level in the stack than mining
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://panteracapital.com'>Dan Morehead</a>:  <blockquote><p>Paul Krugman's thesis that bitcoin consumed $60bn of electricity is bogus as eg the fed spend $4bn on money
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://usat.ly/MgnVZT'>johnshinal</a>:  <blockquote><p>you said Bitcoin is worth roughly $5B - is it too late to invest in bitcoin?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@nshalek'>Nick Shalek</a>:  <blockquote><p>it is still very early in bitcoin - we are at the top of the 1st inning 10M people use it now
<p>bitcoin has a value because it is scarce and useful - the upside is very high - it's a good asymmetric bet
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://about.me/billtai'>Bill Tai</a>:  <blockquote><p>Nick is 99.9% right - I'd be wary fo investing in new infrastructure companies because it is a scale game
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://panteracapital.com'>Dan Morehead</a>:  <blockquote><p>Bill is talking about companies, like bitfury, but you also have the ability to own bitcoin itself
<p>you couldn't buy a chunk of TCP/IP in the 1990s, but you can buy shares in bitcoin the protocol directly
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@nshalek'>Nick Shalek</a>:  <blockquote><p>we invested in BTCjam - a global lending club denominated in bitcoin
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://usat.ly/MgnVZT'>johnshinal</a>:  <blockquote><p>what about things like smart contracts or markets that should exist
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://about.me/billtai'>Bill Tai</a>:  <blockquote><p>what has been successful in tech has been reducing the friction of things that matter. Financial system is ripe
<p>with bitcoin trust is built into the tech, so financial services overhead goes away and can remake the industry
<p>getting rid of the overhead of trust can reduce the cost of financing and lower the friction
<p>in the Philippines legislature is the e-peso initiative - I think that could be important
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://usat.ly/MgnVZT'>johnshinal</a>:  <blockquote><p>lets talk about some of the limiting factors: consolidation of mining or efficiency costs? what puts you off?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@nshalek'>Nick Shalek</a>:  <blockquote><p>the speed at which developers and entrepreneurs move is much faster than regulators and banks do - need a standard
<p>we need a way for bitcoin businesses to find a path to regulation
<p>what worries me is the incumbents moving too slowly and missing the long term upside
<p>if you were the NYT in 1994 you wouldn't shut off the presses then, but you would have invested in the net
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://panteracapital.com'>Dan Morehead</a>:  <blockquote><p>banking regulation around bitcoin is key so entrepreneurs can open accounts and pump money through the system
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://usat.ly/MgnVZT'>johnshinal</a>:  <blockquote><p>you didn't mention security - given Mt Gox, knowing bitcoin can be stolen, or quantum computing?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@nshalek'>Nick Shalek</a>:  <blockquote><p>there are some existential questions you can ask about bitcoin security - we don't really know but 6 years
<p>I don't spend a lot of time thinking about quantum computers becasue they would affect many other things too
<p>I keep all of my bitcoin in companies like coinbase and feel fairly secure. I don't worry about their ability
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://panteracapital.com'>Dan Morehead</a>:  <blockquote><p>the current alternatives have serious security problems too - you can't buy burritos with $100 bills
<p>credit cards were the last major advance and that's just plastic with 8-track tape on the back
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@nshalek'>Nick Shalek</a>:  <blockquote><p>our current payment systems are incredibly insecure, and the breaches we have seen over the last few years show it
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://panteracapital.com'>Dan Morehead</a>:  <blockquote><p>brute force attacks on our current simple authentication protocols are very easy to do
<p>centralising the authentication is not a good idea as it creates a target
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://about.me/billtai'>Bill Tai</a>:  <blockquote><p>fiat and bitcoin are going to coexist as long as I'm alive, though govts may start crypto currencies
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://panteracapital.com'>Dan Morehead</a>:  <blockquote><p>fiat currency to manage money supply has been adopted by most countries, but bitcoin is like gold or credit
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@nshalek'>Nick Shalek</a>:  <blockquote><p>email didn't set out to disrupt the post office - but it did as well as expanding use
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://about.me/billtai'>Bill Tai</a>:  <blockquote><p>banks still require faxes for money transfers, so technology can coexist for a while
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://panteracapital.com'>Dan Morehead</a>:  <blockquote><p>I can see lower tier fiat currencies vanishing - Kenya already has most of its economy in M-PESA
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://usat.ly/MgnVZT'>johnshinal</a>:  <blockquote><p>what do you need to do to educate about the difference in investing in crypto currency?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://about.me/billtai'>Bill Tai</a>:  <blockquote><p>you feel like you want to explain it to them, but the most important point is asymmetric risk
<p>in normal investing you have to spread out the money to cover your losses; bitcoin does that
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@nshalek'>Nick Shalek</a>:  <blockquote><p>in the last 10 years there was a "triumph" of financial engineering and we're all still paying for it
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://panteracapital.com'>Dan Morehead</a>:  <blockquote><p>I spent the first half of my career investing in bonds, currency and investments, not bitcoin is all we do
<p>bitcoin doesn't fit in anyone's organisational chart 
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@nshalek'>Nick Shalek</a>:  <blockquote><p>if some people did't think it was too early Bitcoin wouldn't be an investment opprtunity
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://panteracapital.com'>Dan Morehead</a>:  <blockquote><p>I think tipping is going to be the next phase of this and is a seamless way to use bitcoin 
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@nshalek'>Nick Shalek</a>:  <blockquote><p>the use cases have been very mixed and varied - Amazon used to be for obscure books, ebay for pez dispensers
<p>microtransactions, machine to machine, small international payments, but don't dismiss a store of value
<p>more will be mined but there is a limit to how many will exist
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://about.me/billtai'>Bill Tai</a>:  <blockquote><p>the youth market matters -my 15 year old doesn't see it as different form other payemnts
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@nshalek'>Nick Shalek</a>:  <blockquote><p>in 1994 we might have talked about email the way we talk about microtransactions now, but Google and FB came too
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://panteracapital.com'>Dan Morehead</a>:  <blockquote><p>bitcoin is at a pre Mosaic browser inflection point - VC in bitcoin tripled in 2014, 
<p>you have the choice with bitcoin to invest in the protocol or the companiesâ€”more leverage in co's less diverse
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@nshalek'>Nick Shalek</a>:  <blockquote><p>lending is the worlds largest market - we expect digital currency to take this over
<p>generation Y is not going to invest in the same way their parents have
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.identitywoman.net'>Kaliya-IdentityWoman</a>:  <blockquote><p>you said authentication needs to be improved - the govt wants 2-factor auth too. What apart form bitcoin?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@nshalek'>Nick Shalek</a>:  <blockquote><p>for us bitcoin is part of what we are doing, but the changing of the guard in financial services is key
<p>we haven't invested in identity or authentication but solving compliance or know your customer is interesting
<p>coinbase relies on a number of interesting startups that manage compliance for them as a service
<p>Blockscore (stripe for compliance) coudl be interesting
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://about.me/billtai'>Bill Tai</a>:  <blockquote><p>i have a lot of other investments but not in money related - big data in financial services is going to may
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://kevinmarks.com'>Kevin Marks</a>:  <blockquote><p>at what point do you start accounting in bitcoin yourselves rather than dollars?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://panteracapital.com'>Dan Morehead</a>:  <blockquote><p>not for a very long time-  people think in their own currency and translate
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://about.me/billtai'>Bill Tai</a>:  <blockquote><p>my 15 year old can tell me how much he has in bitcoin to 2 decimal places, but has no idea how many dollars he has
