<p><a class='h-card u-category' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>welcome to SF homebrew website club where it's all about what you want to put up on your own domain or on the web
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='https://kylewm.com'>KyleWm</a>:  <blockquote><p>I just changed my twitter id - I can't be <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/kylewm">@kylewm</a> on twitter so I got this one
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://bengo.is'>Benjamin Goering</a>:  <blockquote><p>if you file a support ticket you can reclaim an unused twitter handle - that's how I got <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/bengo">@bengo</a>
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>if you do change your twitter handle, do reclaim the old one, as otherwise external links will fail
<p>AOL and Yahoo have both started reissuing email addresses, which can get confusing
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://kevinmarks.com'>Kevin Marks</a>:  <blockquote><p>all external links to twitter go to handles, not userids
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://bengo.is'>Benjamin Goering</a>:  <blockquote><p>at livefyre we store the twitter id, not the handle so that it does persist across changes
<p>i've looked into the process of getting TLD this week, and it is very expensive
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>the twitter linking in general goes to the @ name not the userid which is fragile
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://bengo.is'>Benjamin Goering</a>:  <blockquote><p>at livefyre we have to do an api call to get the persistent id - there was an external url before, not sure now
<p>we had to remove all facebook @ mentions because of the api 2.0 changes
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='https://kylewm.com'>KyleWm</a>:  <blockquote><p>we had the same issue with <a class="auto-link" href="http://brid.gy">brid.gy</a> and unable to link to facebook users reliably
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://bengo.is'>Benjamin Goering</a>:  <blockquote><p>you can link to twitter userids via twitter intents - eg <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/t">@t</a> is <a class="auto-link" href="https://twitter.com/intent/user?user_id=11628">https://twitter.com/intent/user?user_id=11628</a>
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://kevinmarks.com'>Kevin Marks</a>:  <blockquote><p>I'm <a class="auto-link" href="https://twitter.com/intent/user?user_id=57203">https://twitter.com/intent/user?user_id=57203</a> on twitter - clearly low numbers have bragging rights like short handles, eh <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/t">@t</a>
<p><a class="auto-link" href="http://noterlive.com">noterlive.com</a> uses twitter to look up names and URLs - if you don't have a url set it uses a twitter url
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>Indiewebcamp cambridge was last week, and had more people than last year and more diverse in terms of users
<p>one guy got drupal webmentions working. Drupal is a CMS like wordpress, and he made a webmention plugin
<p>supporting webmentions is one of the best ways to make a CMS indieweb friendly
<p>webmention was made by Sandeep Shetty <a class="auto-link" href="http://www.sandeep.io/webmention/">http://www.sandeep.io/webmention/</a> - he's in india and none of us here  have met him
<p>at indiewebcamp we did a lot of demos at the end of what people got working over the 2 days
<p>someone built an implementation of the http LINK verb - but no-one responds to it. You have to start somewhere
<p>tilde.club is <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/ftrain">@ftrain</a>'s social hack reframing a single unix server as a social network - you have a url at /~username
<p>someone got a demo of tilde.club running indieweb sites
<p>someone else got <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/withknown">@withknown</a> working on a tor onion address 
<p><a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/rhiaro">@rhiaro</a> got posts working on her own website, and event RSVPs to indie events - webmentions for RSVPs
<p>a lot of people worked on locations of a note versus location checkins explicitly into a venue
<p>in microformats there is no inheritance, just top-level objects that can have properties, so you don't get implied oddness
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://kevinmarks.com'>Kevin Marks</a>:  <blockquote><p>hierarchies go back to Aristotle, and make sense for filing books that have to be in one place, but not how we think
<p>we instead think of things relative to prototypes - robins have more birdness than penguins or emus
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://meta.ly'>EJ Harkness</a>:  <blockquote><p>twitter having <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/foursquare">@foursquare</a> will make it more interesting to check in to places and it gets around the character
<p>I want to post a location to twitter to add context or irony to a location
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://bengo.is'>Benjamin Goering</a>:  <blockquote><p>we take advantage of twitter geocoding to see what tweets are where at <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/livefyre">@livefyre</a>
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>I went to a <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/gigaom">@gigaom</a> conference and learned that they are running tons of geolocation anlaytics
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://kevinmarks.com'>Kevin Marks</a>:  <blockquote><p>geolocation has population density issues - it is hard because population density is a fractal
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>that reminds me of <a class="auto-link" href="http://xkcd.com/1138">xkcd.com/1138</a>
<p>a lot of us worked on event support at indiewebcamp cambridge - redwind does it and known
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://bengo.is'>Benjamin Goering</a>:  <blockquote><p>what do you need as well as a posting of an event on your site?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>you then need to send invitations and accept RSVPs too, and they expect comments too - lots of  thinsg involved
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://bengo.is'>Benjamin Goering</a>:  <blockquote><p>I've been setting up my domain as an excuse to learn things like google compute engine and docker
<p>if you have your own domain ideally it's pretty cheap -what happens if it is bigger than you can handle?
<p>I have set up my dns record to go to a google load balancer so it can go across multiple sites
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://kevinmarks.com'>Kevin Marks</a>:  <blockquote><p>it's easier to migrate things across a redundant array of inexpensive clouds with static files
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://bengo.is'>Benjamin Goering</a>:  <blockquote><p>I am using docker to migrate images between different cloud services
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://kevinmarks.com'>Kevin Marks</a>:  <blockquote><p>don't forget to ask the internet archive to index your urls as you post them, and they will host CCd audio and video
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>scaling is an interesting problem - one of the things we do is make it as dirt simple as possible
<p>a personal blog is well suited to flat files - you don't run out of database connection
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://bengo.is'>Benjamin Goering</a>:  <blockquote><p>kafka is good at queueing a lot of links in response to a twitter-like burst of queues
<p>google used to have a pubsubhubbub part in analytics
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>I deployed PuSH 0.4 for updates from my homepage - I switched from google's hub to superfeeder
<p>we now have multiple people implementing PuSH 0.4 posting and reading
