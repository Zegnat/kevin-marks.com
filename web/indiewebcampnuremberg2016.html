<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://adactio.com'>Jeremy Keith</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>you'll notice there's an attribute on each of these links that says rel="me"
<p>that lets me use this clever thing called indieauth to log into my own site using twitter or facebook or something
<p>all I need to do is add a few characters to my own site to mark this up, as the silos link back
<p>from my perspective as a site owner I didn't need to do much to set this up, and I get lots of benefits
<p>something I decided to do a while ago was to post my tweets to my own site first
<p>now the point is not just to keep things to yourself on your own site, but to share them out to twitter or flickr too
<p>to get the responses back on my own site via webmention I use a service called <a class="auto-link" href="http://brid.gy">brid.gy</a> that sends them to me
<p>this is the idea of POSSE, which is a terrible acronym for Post on your Own Site, Share Elsewhere
<p>longer posts I share to medium for "Engagement" - you connect to the world
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>this is my site <a class="auto-link" href="http://tantek.com">tantek.com</a> that does many of the same things as Jeremy
<p>one of the things that motivated me to use my own site rather than twitter was not having arrows for next post
<p>similar to Jeremy I copy my posts to twitter - if it's a photo I cross post to facebook as well as twitter
<p>something I did recently was make all my silo accounts private, so if you want to share my posts you use my url not theirs
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://aaronparecki.com/'>Aaron Parecki</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I'm Aaron of <a class="auto-link" href="http://aaronpk.com">aaronpk.com</a> - this is my website which is similar, short notes, blogposts, photos etc
<p>what I want to show is replies - Jeremy said he gets comments and replies back from twitter
<p>if someone likes a post I just show their faces with a heart, but if they reply I show the full post
<p>I'm signing in to <a class="auto-link" href="https://quill.p3k.io/">https://quill.p3k.io/</a> with my own domain - I recently changed from <a class="auto-link" href="http://indieauth.com">indieauth.com</a> to my site
<p>This means I can have fine-grained permissions for each micropub client
<p>I replied to a post of Jeremy's with a comment one my site, adn it sent a webmention, so his site shows the comment
<p>now I have a copy of my reply on my site, and Jeremy has one on his and we're not replying on twitter to converse
<p>so you saw Quill as an editor, that uses micropub to post to my site
<p>then when I reply to Jeremy's site it uses webmention to tell him I commented on his site
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://voxpelli.com'>Pelle Wessman</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I have built tools using webmention so you can have mentions on your static sites, like github pages
<p>this is at <a class="auto-link" href="http://webmention.herokuapp.com">webmention.herokuapp.com</a> and you sign up with github, and use it for your sites
<p>many people have used this including <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/kevinmarks">@kevinmarks</a> - you can see I need to add pagination
<p>Kevin uses <a class="auto-link" href="http://brid.gy">brid.gy</a> so if anyone mentions kevin on twitter it shows up on his site
<p>I have micropub set up too so I can post to my site from my phone, which posts by doing a github pull
<p>so I can have micropub working even though I use Jekyll
<p>I have also made a crawler called relspider, but now I'm focusing on micropub and webmention for jekyll
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://adactio.com'>Jeremy Keith</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>apart from the functionality of these tools, the other reason we use them is because they are well-defined and easy
<p>the technical stuff underneath is in a good state, but it is fun to work on the user interface as well
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://voxpelli.com'>Pelle Wessman</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>the other thing I have is these 3 buttons on the bottom of my site that allow retweet, reply and like
<p>this enables an indieconfig that loads a configuration for you to use your own site, or fall back to twitter
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://waterpigs.co.uk'>Barnaby Walters</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I'm Barnaby and my website is regrettably <a class="auto-link" href="https://waterpigs.co.uk">https://waterpigs.co.uk</a>
<p>if you go to <a class="auto-link" href="https://indiewebcamp.com/irc/today?beta#bottom">https://indiewebcamp.com/irc/today?beta#bottom</a> we have great logs of the irc and you can join in by talking to us
<p>irc is where a lot of the indieweb discussion goes on, and we have logs that go on forever
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>we deliberately decided to not have a mailing list, to encourage people to be brief or post on their website
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://waterpigs.co.uk'>Barnaby Walters</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>so what I want to demo is live audio streaming using my own server using PureData
<p>I built this puredata patch that connects to an icecast server running on my website
<p>so I can copy the m3u from this to my site and make a note that posts it
<p>so I'm aadding a stream in an <audio> tag, and a geolocation
<p>what I want is to archive this with a link to the recorded audio when I finish streaming
<p>because micropub lets you update posts, I should be able to replace the m3u with an mp3 link
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://jkphl.is'>Joschi Kuphal 吉</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I use typo3 for my website <a class="auto-link" href="http://jkphl.is">http://jkphl.is</a> because we use that for everything
<p>I am accepting and even sending webmentions
<p>I am collecting responses from sites using both <a class="auto-link" href="http://brid.gy">brid.gy</a> and my own code
<p>i would like to post more status updates, photos and check-ins. It's too complicated rightnow
<p>half a year ago I started writing a concept called apparat, and am building it as a set of libraries
<p>I want to store them as simply as possible in text form in the filesystem
<p>I have a ystem for storing files that are markdown based and I would like to get this in a browser this weekend
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://lukasrosenstock.net/'>Lukas Rosenstock</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I am hosting my site on a silo called <a class="auto-link" href="http://app.net">app.net</a>, which is a twitter rival you pay for
<p>my site takes all the post from the API and presents them in an interface
<p>favorites, reposts and replies come from the <a class="auto-link" href="http://app.net">app.net</a> APi and I translate them into microformats 
<p>I also accept indieweb replies via webmention, and I can send response to my site and <a class="auto-link" href="http://app.net">app.net</a>
<p>my code is up at <a class="auto-link" href="http://github.com/LukasRos/phpADNSite">github.com/LukasRos/phpADNSite</a> - it is PESOS rather than POSSE
<p>but if <a class="auto-link" href="http://app.net">app.net</a> shuts down I can still serve from local storage
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://aaronparecki.com/'>Aaron Parecki</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I've been working on a tool to help you debug your webmentions - it's called http://webmention.rocks
<p>each test shows the webmentions received as comments, likes and emoji on the post
<p>webmention.rocks also sends very detailed error messages, unlike most practical webmention implementations
<p>If I click here to post a favorite, it shows up on the other site straight away
<p>once you get it working on 1, make sure you test on all 21 as it will find edge cases in your code
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>one thing I added to photo posts this year is person tagging. I tag people on my post, and use <a class="auto-link" href="http://brid.gy">brid.gy</a> publish
<p>that shares it to other sites like facebook and twitter, and transfers the person tags 
<p>on my site I get to choose the poster frame for the video, not just the first frame like you get on twitter
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://adactio.com'>Jeremy Keith</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I want to show <a class="auto-link" href="http://indiewebify.me">indiewebify.me</a>
<p>if you're working on adding indieweb features to your app <a class="auto-link" href="http://indiewebify.me">indiewebify.me</a> helps a lot
<p>we've all gravitated to these technologies now, but the main thing is about having your own website
<p>there's lots of levels here - son't be overwhelmed, it builds up for simple building blocks
<p>this is a barcamp style event, which is basically organised chaos - we just have rooms and times
