#annotation @tilgovi: Annotations are additions - links, block quotes, inline - microformats and microdata; out of band webmention + pingback
#annotation @tilgovi: we want annotations to be decentralized, so they need to interoperate with a data model and component models
#annotation @tilgovi: We are going to need syndication and discovery for annotations 
#annotation @tilgovi: we want a more read/write web - we deserve the freedom to reference, not overload URI syntax forever
#annotation @tilgovi: how do we go from out of band to inline? How do you show a remote annotation in the text you're reading
#annotation @tilgovi: existing event targets are DOM element, but we want to target the data -the text of the page idea: event.dataTarget
#annotation @tilgovi: how about a selection pseudo element - can we describe a selection, style it and not modify the DOM - like a:visited
#annotation @tilgovi: we need feed discovery - Activity Streams. Also we need to publish locally and use WebMention http://indiewebcamp.com/webmention
#annotation @cgallello: I'm PM on Office Online, working on accessibility - we have annotations in Office and visual studio already
#annotation @cgallello: red underlines in Word and breakpoints in Visual Studio are annotations form our point of view [machine generated]
#annotation @cgallello: we've been thinking about how to connect screen readers to annotations - to know there is one, to jump in and out
#annotation @cgallello: we can use an aria.annotationtype of "comment" and point to the element with the comment with aria.annotatedby
#annotation @AnnaGerber: Annotation is used throughout the research process, and for teaching not just as part of publications
#annotation @AnnaGerber: researchers need to annotate maps, 3D spaces, protein models, sensor data streams , textual variants
#annotation @AnnaGerber: scholary annotation requirements: citable; precise; of segments/regions; many data types; within dynamic web apps
#annotation @AnnaGerber: we need to migrate annotations across multiple copies of identical resources, or modified ones
#annotation @AnnaGerber: stand-off annotation is needed to maintain integrity of original resources
#annotation @AnnaGerber: we use the Annotea, OA model so have shared generic backend, but need protocols and APIs too
#annotation @AnnaGerber: the OA model is extremely flexible, but diffciult to implement as the queries are hard to write
#annotation @seanboisen: Logos is a digital library for biblical studies, with very rich annotation and cross referencing tools
#annotation @seanboisen: our app is not out on the web, but a desktop app you download.
#annotation @seanboisen: Bible has book/chapter/verse and we add word, but they are different between some bibles
#annotation @seanboisen: we care about cross-lingual word alignment for annotations, which requires extra standardizations
#annotation @nickstenning: data models are simple; protocols harder, but user interactions are hard enough that we'd take us years to agree
#annotation @nickstenning: a bookmarklet is basically a cross-site scripting attack. A standard known as content security policy breaks them
#annotation @nickstenning: Browser extensions are not standardised - every user agent has its own extension model
#annotation @nickstenning: Does anyone know for proposals to allow user-trusted code to run in the DOM in a standard way? Nope
#annotation @nickstenning: we either need to spec ALL the things, or build for pluralism so there are many ways to do it
#annotation James Williamson: As a publisher, having notes you take on Kindle not translating to ibooks is really annoying
#annotation James Williamson: we get complaints from readers all the time about the "1000 people marked this page" stuff in Kindle 
#annotation James Williamson: we do pop-ups of footnotes and publication history in our online journals
#annotation James Williamson: we have third party annotations from reference management and social media crawling
#annotation James Williamson: the only way to annotate our works is with the "contact us" button that emails the publisher- can take 2 years
#annotation James Williamson: we have multiple different annotations at different levels of the publishing process paper/Word/PDF
#annotation James Williamson: we have extensive annotations in our new journals online product , and for assignments and quizzes
#annotation James Williamson: what happens to annotations when content has been deleted? Or out of print? [odd concept for web]
#annotation @fjhirsch: people annotate books but also movies and sound too where you have to point at timestamps
#annotation @fjhirsch: teachers comment on student assignments and students can respond inline
#annotation @fjhirsch: provenance of annotations is important - this brings in identity issues. Iterating them is also hard
#annotation @fjhirsch: I don't think we should rework the Open Annotation data model, but we need RESTful search and JSON-LD output
#annotation @AnnaGerber: we have covered the data model but not the protocol. 
#annotation Timothy Cole: for scholarly text we need individual words and phrases as anchors, even when adjacent content is updated
#annotation Timothy Cole: correction of OCR and manual transcriptions, and of automated part-of-speech tagging
#annotation Timothy Cole: we need proposed corrections to be able to be reviewed and annotated themselves
#annotation Timothy Cole: for example we annotate the scan with the original OCR and the OCR with the corrections
#annotation @EricAubourg: STM is a small publisher with complex texts including arabic, hebrew and heiroglyphics
#annotation @EricAubourg: our policy is ePub firts, no DRM, one purchase for all formats
#annotation @EricAubourg: we have ePub with interactive maps of the Karnak temple that link to images of the wall paintings
#annotation @EricAubourg: referencing other works is required for scholarly publications, but page number doesn't work across editions
#annotation @EricAubourg: for epub we need something user-raedable and reader-processable - people like "page 23" not ids
#annotation @EricAubourg: we need it to be independent of paper, pdf, epub that can survive reflowing, and human readable
#annotation @EricAubourg: in epub you can mark the page boundaries of the original document in the HTML but doesn't go the other way
#annotation @EricAubourg: numbered paragraphs within chapters can work for finished works -  easy to quote
#annotation @EricAubourg: we need readable shortcuts, not 64-character hashes - like link shorteners
#annotation @EricAubourg: we want the target refernce to be human processable
#annotation @kevinmarks: q: isn't a quotation from the work the most robust reference across paper+ edocs 10 words are unique?
#annotation @EricAubourg: yes, quotation is good and robust, and human readable, but it can be a bit long 
#annotation Fred Chasen: the interactions in the various different document viewers are cumbersome and inconsistent
#annotation Fred Chasen: creating the notes content first and then anchoring to the document makes more sense
#annotation Fred Chasen: robust note authoring shouldn't block what you are annotating. It should let you re-anchor after composition
#annotation Fred Chasen: we need to account for longer notes, that may be longer than the entire text
#annotation Fred Chasen: also define print styles for CSS so that users can print out the whole thing
#annotation @KristofCsillag: at Hypothes.is we're working on an annotation system for the web and we have proposed solutions
#annotation @KristofCsillag:  annotating web documentsnis good, but we added PDF, Epub and would like to add scribd and google docs too
#annotation @KristofCsillag: we define a target with generic selectors xpath, but also text position and text content selectors 
#annotation @KristofCsillag: by having multiple selectors we can use fuzzy matching to find the parts we want
#annotation @KristofCsillag: there is a problem with dynamic sites, we need dynamic anchoring - comments can be oprhaned
#annotation @KristofCsillag: knowing what is actually the target across documents can be very hard
#annotation @kevinmarks: if you remove annotations when the document referenced is edited can't unfavourable ones be removed?
#annotation @KristofCsillag: yes, but we can keep orphaned annotations and possibly keep old versions
#annotation @AnnaGerber: how do you cope with copyright issues of keeping quotations?
#annotation @KristofCsillag: right now we don't care about copyright - we are focused on making the annotations robust
#annotation @nickstenning: there are difficult problems around how you display disappeared content to the user, and how to reanchor
#annotation @t: the anchoring problem is important - cool URLs don't change
#annotation @t: question the assumption of annotation providers, how about self-hosted annotation, anchor and context too
#annotation @kevinmarks: we should standardize multiple anchor formats - link, cite, text, image, audio snippet rather than how to be fuzzy
#annotation @AnnaGerber: when thinking about anchoring, focus on the content, not just the document format
