<h2>Power Asymmetry</h2>
<aside>I didn't live tweet this, so don't have linked attributions; I've used first names where I have them, and ðŸ’¬ where I missed them - the ðŸ’¬ were from various speakers</aside>
<div class="h-cite"><span class="h-card">Annabelle</span>: <blockquote class="p-content">continue woman's breakfast thoughts on representation of groups we are supposed to be serving - refugees was a strong point</blockquote></div>
ðŸ’¬ <blockquote class="p-content"> the book Asymmetric Society is worth reading: main actors were people; now businesses</blockquote></div>
ðŸ’¬ <blockquote class="p-content">  A person to a website relationship is very imbalanced - the problem with infocards is you create an illusion that people have power in the relationships, but the big site has more.</blockquote></div>
ðŸ’¬ <blockquote class="p-content">Fairness and justice matter we have an opportunity to level inequality</blockquote></div>
ðŸ’¬ <blockquote class="p-content">Privacy Power differential in tech</blockquote></div>
ðŸ’¬ <blockquote class="p-content">Anonymity can be powerful - an anonymous article was cited in Japanese parliament on daycare issues giving a voice</blockquote></div>
<div class="h-cite"><span class="h-card">Bill</span>: <blockquote class="p-content">how do we reshape  structure for more symmetry?</blockquote></div>
<aside>[Kaliya reshapes room into a circle of chairs]</aside>
<div class="h-cite"><span class="h-card">Annabelle</span>: <blockquote class="p-content">there are models of fairness where they don't really exist. The Personal Cloud initiative rely on individuals having an electronic resource that they own and maintain. We rely on individuals having the time and money to take care of that. We get data anonymity and power for those with the luxury to afford this</blockquote></div>
<div class="h-cite"><span class="h-card">Kaliya</span>: <blockquote class="p-content">Bob Blakely and I have a paper based on a keynote we did on this. Those with wealth and power have more ability to maintain their identity</blockquote></div>
<div class="h-cite"><span class="h-card">Annabelle</span>: <blockquote class="p-content">if you have the resources you can remove advertising</blockquote></div>
ðŸ’¬ <blockquote class="p-content">if everything relies on advertising, do we have to reconsider that way of funding the web?</blockquote></div>
<div class="h-cite"><span class="h-card">Annabelle</span>: <blockquote class="p-content">"you can chose to sell your data" - we're still framing it as commerce - selling yourself as a product</blockquote></div>
<div class="h-cite"><span class="h-card">David</span>: <blockquote class="p-content">that happens because of lack of trust - if you could trust the assertions we make, would be paid for by the risk reduction for the RPs</blockquote></div>
<div class="h-cite"><span class="h-card">Annabelle</span>: <blockquote class="p-content">if you're a content provider with revenue from advertising, trust isn't going to affect your need to sell that information</blockquote></div>
<div class="h-cite"><span class="h-card">Kevin</span>: <blockquote class="p-content">if we have verifiable claims we are creating an incentive for redlining to prove you only have high value readers</blockquote></div>
<div class="h-cite"><span class="h-card">Lewis</span>: <blockquote class="p-content">VRM is premised on people having the power to share their own data, and get back power from markets</blockquote></div>
<div class="h-cite"><span class="h-card">Annabelle</span>: <blockquote class="p-content">markets don't work that way in practice: in theory every consumer has the ability to shop anywhere for food or banking; in practice a lot of that ends up based on redlining through store location</blockquote></div>
<div class="h-cite"><span class="h-card">Lewis</span>: <blockquote class="p-content">I don't think VRM will take us to the promised land, but we should look at radical changes</blockquote></div>
<div class="h-cite"><span class="h-card">Mike</span>: <blockquote class="p-content">Any situation between humans and businesses is asymmetric by default, as the trust model we rely on as humans doesn't work. One way to solve this is to incorporate everyone, - and I'm Mike, Inc and I sue you</blockquote></div>
<div class="h-cite"><span class="h-card">Annabelle</span>: <blockquote class="p-content">you can't copyright facts</blockquote></div>
<div class="h-cite"><span class="h-card">David</span>: <blockquote class="p-content">I like inverting the "corporations are people" trope but it doesn't really change the power</blockquote></div>
ðŸ’¬ <blockquote class="p-content">If corporations have the capacity to mine us to create IP based on our data - the deepest from of IP is our identity; why can't we copyright our identity.</blockquote></div>
<div class="h-cite"><span class="h-card">Kaliya</span>: <blockquote class="p-content">I want to talk about power asymmetry in the physical world - even how we sit in the circle and who is choosing to sit how - how much space do you take up expresses power and comfort. We watch that happen and need to help those signalling lower power and bring them in. This kind of observational skill and leadership is essential.
If we want to make space designed to get input from different populations.
There are also gender race and class asymmetries that happen in this community which we don't always bring up.</blockquote></div>
<div class="h-cite"><span class="h-card">Mike</span>: <blockquote class="p-content">there really is real discrimination on the internet. If the thing on the other end thinks you're a woman or a man, or in certain zipcode you see different prices and ads</blockquote></div>
ðŸ’¬ <blockquote class="p-content">My daughter is a sociology major, and helped me think about BlackLivesMatter that colour-blindness is not a thing that we can do - classism in power asymmetry is going to fail everybody</blockquote></div>
<div class="h-cite"><span class="h-card">Annabelle</span>: <blockquote class="p-content">people's identity and the various privileges and systems of opression impacts their experience online - certain groups have to think more about their identity online have to present themselves. A great example is women in the gaming community over gamergate where women are attacked mercilessly for having an opinion on games while female, and presenting as a women can be a threat.</blockquote></div>
<div class="h-cite"><span class="h-card">Kaliya</span>: <blockquote class="p-content">because our culture has a lot of power asymmetry it causes problems inherently</blockquote></div>
<div class="h-cite"><span class="h-card">Annabelle</span>: <blockquote class="p-content">Facebooks policy for 'real names' discriminated against Native people's names because they don't look 'real' to the algorithm, or transgender people who don't use their birthnames.</blockquote></div>
<div class="h-cite"><span class="h-card">Anil</span>: <blockquote class="p-content">what can we do in order to not impose the first world perspective. What can we do proactively to ensure that. I went to a workshop with non-profits on the role of identity for people who have been trafficked. If you require them to have an identity it makes them much more targetted, which I hadn't considered. As architects, what can we do to bring in those perspectives.</blockquote></div>
ðŸ’¬ <blockquote class="p-content">Maybe we should get rid of gender given what goes wrong,. The way we classify our identity gets encoded in code, it's nto black or white. It gets messy</blockquote></div>
<div class="h-cite"><span class="h-card">David</span>: <blockquote class="p-content">if the laws of identity are true, then people can assert different identities.</blockquote></div>
<div class="h-cite"><span class="h-card">Annabelle</span>: <blockquote class="p-content">we can't rely on market forces to protect the rights of minorities - they don't have market power by definition - how do we inject ethics into the system?</blockquote></div>
<div class="h-cite"><span class="h-card">Anil</span>: <blockquote class="p-content">this is not abstract for me - I fill out where the market forces don't make sense - i need to bring an investment convening perspective; I don't know the answers. Although I am not the same complexion fo people here, I'm not at the margins of society. Problems of power asymmetry exist - what can we do to provide solutions.</blockquote></div>
<div class="h-cite"><span class="h-card">Bill</span>: <blockquote class="p-content">what are design principle that we can build into this - we need to bring people into the deign process. Native Americans, transgender, people fleeing abuse. Identity and relationship matters.</blockquote></div>
<div class="h-cite"><span class="h-card">Kevin</span>: <blockquote class="p-content">markets can empower too - eBay created ways for people to build businesses, whereas advertising is based on stereotyping and prejudice</blockquote></div>
<div class="h-cite"><span class="h-card">Annabelle</span>: <blockquote class="p-content">the same day delivery article re amazon is a good example of unintended consequences - Prime users in certain neighbourhoods gave a racist/classist effect that gave a power imbalance. evaluate your decisions based on that. That we are in this room is indicative of privilege; we are going to make mistakes. When we get feedback from a community we need to be receptive to that feedback. No one solution is going to work for every community. The way that social space has evolved o n he internet - 10 years ago the forum was the be-all and end all -there were walled garden communities with moderators and known membership. We have evolved into this twitter/tumblr model wehere everyone is screaming at each other. When you talk to the social justice community there is a struggle to create safe spaces for people. You can't do that without that behaviour injecting into that space  - a single global community doesn't work. Especially when you have groups with mutually conflicting needs for their safe space. We need to recognise that systems don't work for everybody.</blockquote></div>
ðŸ’¬ <blockquote class="p-content">Discrimination lawsuits work for race, gender etc but we don't have that based on class. If we dissect power that is correlated with wealth and privilege. If a child has a collection of power imbalances. Class and poverty being the overwhelming factor.</blockquote></div>
<div class="h-cite"><span class="h-card">Kevin</span>: <blockquote class="p-content">class in a different sense is legally represented by class action lawsuits</blockquote></div>
<div class="h-cite"><span class="h-card">Anil</span>: <blockquote class="p-content">privacy and security become a luxury good, only available to a specific class of people. I know nothing about Bill Gates's kids because he can provide that buffer. It's an example of it being a luxury good. Look at the design of systems.</blockquote></div>
<div class="h-cite"><span class="h-card">Kaliya</span>: <blockquote class="p-content">one of the things we need to think about is how we talk to different populations. I would like to write some kind of document about in person dynamics. I'd like to invite people who havent' been aware fo that to have some kind fo knowledge about it. Those who choose to speak about dynamics we see get pushed back on as victims.</blockquote></div>
ðŸ’¬ <blockquote class="p-content">Literacy and awareness of this is key</blockquote></div>
<div class="h-cite"><span class="h-card">Mike</span>: <blockquote class="p-content">telcos, military kinds of things are part fo our models -top down, command and control. Our identity systems place people into roles they have to play. we have created a software tradition that is an embodiment of our beliefs that this should eb an asymmetric system. What does a symmetrical system look like.</blockquote></div>
<div class="h-cite"><span class="h-card">Bill</span>: <blockquote class="p-content">how our stances in the room effect our design. Watching IIW try to shift the dynamics. Developing a literacy of power. </blockquote></div>
<div class="h-cite"><span class="h-card">Kevin</span>: <blockquote class="p-content">the language of standards is an authoritarian one, and we are told MUST and SHOULD and MAY, and have all evidence and examples removed</blockquote></div>

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://doc.searls.com'>Doc Searls</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>what is called advertising these days is actually Direct Marketing, which has always been annoying
<p>the whole adtech industry is falling apart. I know one $100M adtech company that says it is a zombie
<p>while advertisers are putting ads in front of you that take 300ms to appear, they pay the adtech in 120 days
<p>The reason you see toe fungus ads everywhere is because of tracking you across sites
<p>there used to be a few name brand agencies, now there are thousands of adtech companies, and publishers don't control them
<p>there's a phrase in the Big Short "wherever you have a mania and fraud, there is a bubble" Adtech has both
<p>Don Marti wrote about the toe fungus ad problem here <a class="auto-link" href="http://blog.aloodo.org/posts/service-journalism/">http://blog.aloodo.org/posts/service-journalism/</a>
<p>CHEDDAR is a list of rules for making acceptable ads: <a class="auto-link" href="http://blog.aloodo.org/posts/new-acronym/">http://blog.aloodo.org/posts/new-acronym/</a>
<p>CNAMEs: Ads, and other third-party resources such as analytics scripts, served from a subdomain of the publisher's domain
<p>HTML5: avoid the malvertising risks of vintage plugins by using web standards only. 
<p>Encryption: Limit the ability of ISPs and other observers to gather user data that can be used for targeting later.
<p>Data leakage protection: Many users are still unprotected from web tracking - notify them and offer incentives
<p>Do Note Track: use the EFF DNT policy on your site <a class="auto-link" href="https://www.eff.org/dnt-policy">https://www.eff.org/dnt-policy</a>
<p>Accountability: accurate WHOIS info for everything in the adtech chain. No anonymous registrations.
<p>Reciprocity:  an offer of signal from the advertiser for attention from the audience.
