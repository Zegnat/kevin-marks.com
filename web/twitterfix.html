I think Dick stepping up is important, as he needs to overrule the engagement at all costs mindset that is damaging the support process.

They do have 2 internal systems that do big data analysis - but one is focused on spam, and the other is on advertising segmentation. 

the spam one is botmaker:

So, they have the analytic ability to cluster gaters and other groups, at least well enough for ad targetting (note how they infer 'gender' in an ad-stereotypic way ) so could do what ggautoblocker does.

They could potentially segment off the feminists from the gaters from actual gamers, and not show @'s between groups or demphasize them.

Note that when they did use botmaker against harassers, the EFF got tetchy about it:
