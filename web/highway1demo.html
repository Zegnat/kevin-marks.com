<p><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://about.me/liamcasey'>liam casey</a>:  <blockquote><p>if you ask big companies, they will tell you that making hardware is hard
<p>we believe in small companies, and that if you can imagine it , it can bemade
<p>these companies challenge us to find new ways to bring products to market in the fastest time
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://trufflehoney.com'>brady forrest</a>:  <blockquote><p>it was about 2 years ago, almost ot this week that Liam asked me out to breakfast, to help hardware companiee
<p>we're on our 3rd class, we've had 35 companies and 10 female founders - and Ringly started shipping bluetooth rings today
<p>Drop went from demo day to the Apple store in 10 months - we want to get that down to 6 months
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.worldfingertips.com'>FingerTips Lab</a>:  <blockquote><p>we're in stealth mode, so don't share this online [oh well]
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@delzerado'>Cara Delzer</a>:  <blockquote><p>Moxxly is a consumer technology company designing for women - we're reimagining the breast pump experience
<p>A breast pump is supposed to free a mom up, and instead it ties her down.
<p>Moxxly has interviewed over 100  women and they said "pumping makes me feel like a cow"
<p>our first product is a discreet pump that sits inside the bra with a collecting device under the blouse
<p>the pump sends information via bluetooth to the mother's phone on flow rate and time
<p>current pumps are built and sold as medical devices - Moxxly is a lifestyle device for the breastfeeding stage of life
<p>we're in a design and engineering sprint, and we are raising a seed round right now - <a class="auto-link" href="http://moxxly.com">moxxly.com</a>
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://trufflehoney.com'>brady forrest</a>:  <blockquote><p>I've been to those milk and cookies sessions - those moms want this pump
<p>our next team is going after computer vision
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@Mashgin'>Mashgin</a>:  <blockquote><p>Can a computer understand what is on your lunch plate? No -because image recognition is hard. What if it could?
<p>computers cannot find everything in a scene, and may not be accurate
<p>current tech is a mixture of 2d camera tech and AI Now we can add 3D reconstruction
<p>by doing 3d reconstruction we can measure multiple simultaneous objects in any orientation
<p>we are going to apply this to the checkout line for cafeterias and small retail venues
<p>as well as recognising the objects we can capture weight and volume and calcualte calories
<p>we have a recognition accuracy of 98%
<p>Compass with 50,000 locations are interested in working with us
<p>there are billions spent annually on checkouts, for a process that customers hate. <a class="auto-link" href="http://mashgin.com">mashgin.com</a>

<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://trufflehoney.com'>brady forrest</a>:  <blockquote><p>this next team is trying to make the aquariam automated, and measure success in fish lives saved
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@Naterock101'>Nathan Levine</a>:  <blockquote><p>Aquariums are absolutely incredible - it's putting the best bits of the ocean in your living room
<p>it's common to get a fish and for it to die within the week
<p>fishbit monitors your tank and water quality in real time
<p>tank monitoring tools have been made by and for aquarium junkies, not normal people
<p>we're designing for the other 87% of the aquarium market, not the experts
<p>we have a suite of sensors that go in your tank in 15 minute sand connects to wifi to tell you what you need
<p>by sensing the tank we can correct some things immediately, or send you the info or product you need directly
<p>taking complicated water sensor data and simplifying it also applies to pools and hot-tubs
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://trufflehoney.com'>brady forrest</a>:  <blockquote><p>we look forward to having some of you help fishbit scale  [groans]
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.myswitchmate.com'>Switchmate</a>:  <blockquote><p>home automation has <2% adoption. Why? we asked people at home depot etc
<p>the installation of these solutions is messy and complicated and people are put off
<p>switchmate snaps on over the switch, meaning install is instant, and you can then control from your phone.
<p>our other competitor is smart lightbulbs, but you probably have fewer switches than bulbs so we're cheaper
<p>we have sent trial units out to paying users across the USA, to get out of the silicon valley bubble
<p>one user originally wanted to control his porch lights, but found it was more useful for bedroom lights moved it
<p>what if you could snap something over the vents in your house, and control them remotely

<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://trufflehoney.com'>brady forrest</a>:  <blockquote><p>I'd like to welcome Doug CEO of <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/navdyinc">@navdyinc</a> - a recent alum
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.navdy.com'>navdy</a>:  <blockquote><p>since demoday we've grown the team to 17 and raised a seed round, and we now have $4.7M in preorders
<p>keep in touch with the Highway 1 alumni - it's a great group for advice
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://perljung.weebly.com'>Per Ljung</a>:  <blockquote><p><a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/lookseelabs">@lookseelabs</a> makes jewellery wearables that display art images and notifciations
<p>we've been standardised into using these little aalck boxes - phones. but we're not standard
<p>we have flexible always on display jewellery (a bangle with a screen on)
<p>you can match all your outfits and moods with a different image
<p>bracelet has a black+white screen that you can update - with 1 year of battery life on a 10 minute charge (e-Ink?)
<p>our target market is women who buy fine jewelery - they love our solid silver bracelets

<a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@Chris_Chuter'>Chris Chuter</a>:  <blockquote><p>Peeple is a device that sits on the inside of your door and looks through the peephole adn sends it to your phone
<p>you will never miss a delivery again as we detect knocks on the door
<p>we can screen who is on the door
<p>we have simple install and a passive sensor - much lees intrusive than a dropcam
<p>according to building code 94-153 - peepholes are required - it's the law, even in Texas
<p>Peeple can unwarp the fisheye lens to give you a clear view of who is at the door
<p>your door is no longer a blind spot

<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://trufflehoney.com'>brady forrest</a>:  <blockquote><p>Cool Chip has reinvented the heat sink
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.coolchiptechnologies.com'>CoolChipTechnologies</a>:  <blockquote><p>everything in computing has increased at exponential rates over the last decades, except the fan cooler
<p>fans are loud,  inefficient and a bottleneck on CPU speed 
<p>the technology is rooted in Darpa tech from Sandia labs, now on our team
<p>we made cooling smaller, cooler and 100x quieter
<p>throughout this talk our kinetic cooling engine has been running. but you can't hear it 
<p>if I turn on the competitive fan that extracts the same amount of heat [sudden loud fan noise]
<p>we're showcasing out first product samples at CES and are interested in gamers to help quiet the xbox
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://trufflehoney.com'>brady forrest</a>:  <blockquote><p>I think <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/coolchiptech">@coolchiptech</a> should be called WhisperChip, but I'm not a branding expert
<p>our next team <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/golagoon">@golagoon</a> is going after water - it's hard to track personal usage
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://goLagoon.com'>Eric Elias</a>:  <blockquote><p>water is a precious resource in the country, and it's getting more scarce because of the drought
<p>another story we hear is about leaks destroying posessions and houses - millions a year
<p><a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/golagoon">@golagoon</a> answers the questions about what the water uses
<p>water meters are dumb. we wrap a sensor around the meter and give it to your mobile app in real time
<p>following our customised water plan can save hundreds
<p>there are >70m single detached homes in the US with >1m already in connected homes
<p>there are 41M rentals in the US with 2m impacted with drought
<p>we're also working with water authorities to track their customers usage for them

<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://daniellephilippi.wordpress.com'>Danielle Philippi</a>:  <blockquote><p><a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/cargolabs">@cargolabs</a> is a connected car platform to make it easy to bring apps to market for older cars
<p>only 3% of cars are connected now, but people want to connect the car they have not buy a new one 
<p>there is a ODBII port standard, but only 1 per car so you have to choose, we give a platform instead
<p>I can see where my confounder is driving my car, and trip history as well as service status
<p>cargo connects to your car but also to your dashcam and other sensors, like a baby seat
<p>we work with car-sharing apps, but also with Dash - garages will give them for free for maintenance opportunities

<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://trufflehoney.com'>brady forrest</a>:  <blockquote><p>our goal is to get companies to a fundable prototype - one that can be manufactured

<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://SaraJChipps.com'>Sara Chipps</a>:  <blockquote><p><a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/jewliebots">@jewliebots</a> is going to get girls coding - teenage girls love tech but they aren't building it
<p>STEm jobs are growing at 77% but girls are missing out
<p>I'm from the generation of people who became software developers because they didn't have any friends
<p>I was a 12 year old homeschooled child who dascovered coding through BBS
<p>we've talked to over 50 girls in the bay area -they want beauty, simplicity and friendship
<p><a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/jewliebots">@jewliebots</a> are programmable jewellery - a mesh network of jewellery that sues lights and vibrations
<p>we have worked with a high school class in berkeley and they have done our product design
<p>using basic logic, we can say "if I'm with julie behave this way" "if I'm at home with mum behave this way"
<p>we think this is an amazing mission, but also a big market - teenage girls spend $450/month
<p>jewliebots being together fashion community and customisation
<p>we want to have jewliebots ready for holiday season next year
<p>in 2010 I started Girl Develop It - we've taught over 6000 women to code alreadt

<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://trufflehoney.com'>brady forrest</a>:  <blockquote><p>a couple of weeks ago we announced that we are teaming up with 500 startups and ZPG to make a show on startups
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='https://roli.com'>ROLI</a>:  <blockquote><p>I'm roland lamb of ROLI - we have made a new musical instrument called the seaboard 
<p>it remimagines the piano keyboard as a series of waves you can play, but slide between the notes
<p>using this elastic material you can play like a piano but also bend the note
<p>it's not just about simulating instruments, but synthesising new instruments
<p>film composers are loving this caapcity to create an expressive orchestral sound
<p>we're based in London - we make Seaboards in railway arches in Dalston
<p>Seaboards are from $2000 to $9000, so not cheaper but very popular with film composers and many recording artists
<p>we're building an interface technology toolchain - keyboards are a 400 year old tehcnology
<p>we have acquired Juce - a C++ framework in use by many music companies to integrate with our sensors
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://trufflehoney.com'>brady forrest</a>:  <blockquote><p>Our next class is Feb to May - we're accepting applications for awesome hardware startups for it
