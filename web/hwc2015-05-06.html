<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://bengo.is'>Benjamin Goering</a>:  <blockquote><p>I found the indie.js repository and am going through the IndiewMark process and trying to make my tools usable by other
<p>the github repository is at <a class="auto-link" href="https://github.com/gobengo/indieweb">https://github.com/gobengo/indieweb</a>
<p>I'm trying to make the place where it posts to pluggable too so you can change where it posts to

<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://werd.io/'>Ben Werdmüller</a>:  <blockquote><p>I went back and analysed everything I posted on <a class="auto-link" href="http://werd.io">werd.io</a> - a tiny fraction had not been syndicated elsewhere
<p>I realised I have been using <a class="auto-link" href="http://werd.io">werd.io</a> as a client for twitter and facebook, so I wrote a post that wasn't POSSE'd <a class="auto-link" href="http://werd.io/2015/publish-on-your-own-site-reflect-inwardly">http://werd.io/2015/publish-on-your-own-site-reflect-inwardly</a>
<p>so what happens if we take away the social newtworks
<p>seperately I'm also preparing to start a podcast, so I'm looking at the tags needed to make a podcast work right
<p>the process of publishing a podcast seems really archaic
<p>a lot of people use soundcloud so they can have a nice player to embed on their own site 
<p>I have lost count of the number of times I have crashed all of the browsers using the audio tag over the last few weeks

<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://bengo.is'>Benjamin Goering</a>:  <blockquote><p>twitter added native video a couple of months ago, and the video that we are getting from twitter is not playable [in older browsers without &lt;video&gt; support

<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://werd.io/'>Ben Werdmüller</a>:  <blockquote><p>I've also made http://wavelist.xyz/ which is a way to easily curate and discover playlist of podcast episodes as a test
<p>it's not completely different form huffduffer, but it is more thematic - it is a playback list around a theme
<p>we have  Convoy at Known that is designed to connect your blog to other sites, and we'll make it for wordpress too

<a class='h-card p-category' href='https://kylewm.com'>Kyle Mahan</a>:  <blockquote><p>wordpress is a convenient unauthenticated shell that happens to have a blogging tool attached
<p>I worked on <a class="auto-link" href="http://feverdream.herokuapp.com/">http://feverdream.herokuapp.com/</a> which lets you post to wordpress, blogger, tumblr with mciropub

<a class='h-card p-category' href='https://kylewm.com'>Kyle Mahan</a>:  <blockquote><p>I have been working on <a class="auto-link" href="http://brid.gy">brid.gy</a> support for known and tumblr integration
<p><a class="auto-link" href="http://brid.gy">brid.gy</a> doesn't currently give enough feedback for known users so I'm working on this

<a class='h-card p-category' href='http://webrecorder.io'>WebRecorder.io</a>:  <blockquote><p>I work on a tool called <a class="auto-link" href="http://webrecorder.io">webrecorder.io</a> to build a new archiving service for everyone to use
<p><a class="auto-link" href="http://beta.webrecorder.io">beta.webrecorder.io</a> is an updated version of the archiving software
<p>flash is always difficult to archive - I was wondering if mozilla shumway could help with that
<p>the proxy runs as a separate app that rewrite them to localhost
<p>unlike internet archive this is more personal - you don't have to put it on a server
<p>all the core functionality is on github in Python if you want ot look at it, and the archive player
<p>you need to go through a browser or a headless browser to be sure that you catch all the links
