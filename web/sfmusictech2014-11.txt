#sfmusictech @kristinthomson: sound recordings weren't a big component of revenues for artists but they are also a reason to go on tour 
#sfmusictech @dave_cool: there are so many different formats - don't print up CDs unless you tour because people want a souvenir 
#sfmusictech @dave_cool: you'd be surprised how much some of your superfans would want to donate to you to thank you for your music
#sfmusictech @zogblog: what about publishing and licensing? isn't thar a different story from recording?
#sfmusictech @INgrooves: revenue used to come from mechanicals - from recording -now it comes from performance and has metadata issues
#sfmusictech @INgrooves: not just you have to get your metadaat right but also the people paying you need to
#sfmusictech @SoundExchange: if you have a hit song, it can be your 401k for a long time  @bandpage: so just write a hit song?
#sfmusictech @INgrooves: it's knowing what your options are to get revenue from at each stage of the cycle are the pennies getting to you?
#sfmusictech @kristinthomson: we found 29 revenue streams for musician in october, now they are up to 45 see money.futureofmusic.org
#sfmusictech @kristinthomson: often it was @soundexchange that surprised people as it is a new source of revenue
#sfmusictech @SoundExchange: last year we gave out $600M, and it will probably be over $700M next year
#sfmusictech @SoundExchange: we work on non-interactive radio like pandora and other indirect licenses. Pandora then Sirius then 2500 others
#sfmusictech @SoundExchange: we pay artists directly and not through labels so no recoupables get taken out of it
#sfmusictech @SoundExchange: terrestrial radio pays ASCAP/BMI for the songwriters but not to performers, so we are working on that now
#sfmusictech @zogblog: streaming services do pay the performer as well as the songwriter, unlike terrestrial radio
#sfmusictech @dave_cool: there are lots of differrent kinds of fan - casual listeners and superfans want everything you are doing
#sfmusictech @dave_cool: we have a metal band that sells branded voodoo dolls and their fans are buying them
#sfmusictech @BandPage: in the gaming business, games were offline, and they had no idea how much you played it. Now they know how much time
#sfmusictech @BandPage: this tracking is now happening in music - with CDs we had no idea how big a fan they were, streaming tells us this
#sfmusictech @BandPage: knowing how to target our customers - our fans - is what we are going through which happened to gaming in 2007
#sfmusictech @BandPage: by knowing the people who listen to them on spotify and rdio we can increase tour revenue by reaching fans
#sfmusictech @INgrooves: you don't have to spend as much money throwing it out into the dark, you can look at the data coming back in
#sfmusictech @BandPage: now I can hand the flyer to the person who listened to me 25 times and invite the one who listened 500 times to meet
#sfmusictech @BandPage: @Patreon is doing well too - every time you release it give them money
#sfmusictech @BandPage: we don't care as bandpage how you are making revenue -we'll pull in anything thta helps bands
#sfmusictech @zogblog: the CD is a dead object, it doesn't tell you anything; artists can tell where music is being streamed
#sfmusictech @INgrooves: there are artists that don't want to ask fans for money - thye offer a preorder rather than a donation
#sfmusictech @BandPage: us up and coming bands never made a lot of money, even when we had CDs to sell
#sfmusictech @BandPage: it's made a huge dip at the high end but as an up and coming band you are still looking for fans individually
#sfmusictech @BandPage: you need to think about how you can interact with fans, and try things out. It's still hard as a small business
#sfmusictech @dave_cool: you're selling socks at Times Square with thousands of other sock sellers in Times Square
#sfmusictech @zogblog: if you were a band with a great album and no money what would you do?
#sfmusictech @dave_cool: rehearse you live show so it is great so everyone talks about it on social media
#sfmusictech @kristinthomson: do you have an intra-band agreement on how the revenue is split between you? you have to pay royalties forever
#sfmusictech @kristinthomson: proper credits are the baseline for your music to discover you and for people like soundexchange to pay you
#sfmusictech @SoundExchange: I do live shows with bands in LA, and I look them up on soundexchange and there is often money waiting for them
#sfmusictech @SoundExchange: we have a problem that sending out letters saying we have money for people looks like spam
#sfmusictech @BandPage: think of your band as a business and look up your customer demographics and try to open for bands in it
#sfmusictech @BandPage: I was sleeping on the floor eating rice and beans when we started bandpage, a band is like a startup
#sfmusictech @INgrooves: I wouldn't spend all my money on making a recording, I'd spend some on working out who your fans are and where
#sfmusictech @dave_cool: if I was a band who'd spent all it's money I'd get a day job or play covers or teach - work a job to pay the bills
#sfmusictech @BandPage: any in-person experience sells very well, whether that's a backstage pass or meet and greet
#sfmusictech @BandPage: fans aren't musicians - they've never been backstage in a shitty pub, they still want to meet you
#sfmusictech @BandPage: take any old merch or piece of inventory, sign it and you can mark it up 20%
#sfmusictech @INgrooves: if you create that connection that fan engagement they remember it and stick around for life
#sfmusictech @BandPage: do a house concert - you can make $500 from that which is often more than small venues
#sfmusictech @dave_cool: doing a surprise release can work great if you're an artist who has years of label marketing behind you
#sfmusictech @zogblog: I've seen songwriters being broken by having placement in a commercial - that can be a surprise
#sfmusictech @dave_cool: knowing who you are as an artist and telling that story and engagaing with fans is part of the job now
#sfmusictech @BandPage: the world is changing, not just in music - it's exciting because it's not just through social networks but streaming
#sfmusictech @BandPage: we used to get traffic through facebook, but now they only show a post to 6% unless you pay; streaming hits more
#sfmusictech @BandPage: it's public and factual that consumers aren't paying for the song so we have to generate revenue other ways
#sfmusictech @BandPage: it used to be patronage, then it was troubadours, then bands in venues, and the jukebox broke that
#sfmusictech @BandPage: the music business has changed a lot, it keeps changing but people need music and will support the musician
#sfmusictech @SoundExchange: I don't know what the pricing model should be on streaming, I'd pay more than $10/month  
#sfmusictech @SoundExchange: pandora pays a lot more for a stream on subscription than on the free service
#sfmusictech @BandPage: we're going to solve this. there are fans who see value in the music that you create, and we will get this to you
#sfmusictech @BRYAN_M_COX: I've been in the music business since the 1990s, so I've seen the transition from tape to DAW
#sfmusictech @BRYAN_M_COX: we just switched to having a mac mini instead of a dedicated workstation
#sfmusictech @BRYAN_M_COX: we can collaborate now, but we still have trouble moving between tracks and sessions in different software
#sfmusictech @BRYAN_M_COX: it is easier now - I've been collaborating with a writer in london and we made 8 recordings together in a week
#sfmusictech @BRYAN_M_COX: i collaborated with an artist I heard on twitter I never met in person but we recorded together sending tracks
#sfmusictech @BRYAN_M_COX: whenever we sold a record we'd have to book another studio to take our DAT tapes into to make a 2" master
#sfmusictech @BRYAN_M_COX: to be part of that era and to see how simplified it is now is amazing
#sfmusictech @TRI_Studios: if you're a recording engineer now coming through college you need to get your IT skills down
#sfmusictech @BRYAN_M_COX: whats amazing now is that artists can do it themselves - when Prince did it he was a genius, now it's normal
#sfmusictech @BRYAN_M_COX: you can go out on YouTube and find out the secrets of the producers and make your own style up
#sfmusictech @BRYAN_M_COX: I remember the Hit Factory closed, and Sony Music Studios closed, and people are doing it all themselves
#sfmusictech @BRYAN_M_COX: people say "technology is fucking up music and no-one is doing real shit" and I met a guy who recorded an EP live
#sfmusictech @smart: we want to bring technology to the musicians so they don't have to mess with files and make it smoother
#sfmusictech @MusisticChief: the production tools are in the hands of the people and anyone can make a record, but some people shouldn't
#sfmusictech @ChrisKantrowitz: the way tehcnology has been built around audio is all these walled gardens - plugins, operating systems, DAWs
#sfmusictech @ChrisKantrowitz: in audio the document problem has not been solved, and musicians have to make  choices
#sfmusictech @ChrisKantrowitz: hopefully companies will be more sensible about their IP so we can plug in as easily as a guitar
#sfmusictech @ChrisKantrowitz: anything we can do to put artists back into a state of flow is important
#sfmusictech @smart: all 3 of us had to build custom code to move music between the different  creation tools to make that work
#sfmusictech @smart: easy sharing of session files and public sharing  - it's like version control in software for music
#sfmusictech @smart: so much in music is catching up to what we have had for software for years
#sfmusictech @TRI_Studios: it seems like audio has fallen behind, why is that?
#sfmusictech @smart: we're in the least sexy part of the music industry, improving workflows
#sfmusictech @BRYAN_M_COX: that's sad though - this is where it starts collaborating across the wire - it's still a process to convert 
#sfmusictech @BRYAN_M_COX: the less time that you have to spend figuring out how to start up the more time you get to create
#sfmusictech @MusisticChief: downtime kills creativity - we want you to stop having to be an IT guy and get back to making music
#sfmusictech @ChrisKantrowitz: a lot of these music companies were founded 20 years ago and never got the open source revolution
#sfmusictech @ChrisKantrowitz: the iOS platform enabled an explosion of creativity but we need to bring that together with these old tools
#sfmusictech @ChrisKantrowitz: plugins are the hardest because they are like a custom instrument inside a song, and they are expensive too
#sfmusictech @ChrisKantrowitz: unifying plugins is really needed
#sfmusictech @ChrisKantrowitz: archiving is also really hard - good luck opening that ProTools session from 20 years ago with the plugins 
#sfmusictech @ChrisKantrowitz: it's companies like us saying "fuck you oldschool, we're doing it ourselves"
#sfmusictech @TRI_Studios: are you incorporating metadata into these tools?
#sfmusictech @MusisticChief: we are tracking the metadata from the plugins as we write them
#sfmusictech @smart: we track every save so we can see who made which edit when
#sfmusictech @smart: we have had to make our own licence the splicence to make it easier to share, as even CC is not clear enough
#sfmusictech @ChrisKantrowitz: this business is so huge - we have users in 120 countries around the world - 3000 people in the Congo use it
#sfmusictech @ChrisKantrowitz: I hope that there are so many companies that create collaborative tools that all this music survives
#sfmusictech @smart: i think you'll see a lot of products come into this space, but there are no comps - we model on github
#sfmusictech @smart: we model on github but we had to build the whole stack not just the social layer
#sfmusictech @smart: we're working with walled gardens and there is a lot of intelligence to break down those walls
#sfmusictech @BRYAN_M_COX: I'm into problem solving - when I'm stuck I'll go look for tools to fix it with google
#sfmusictech @BRYAN_M_COX: the business of music is changing, and that effects what happens in a creative perspective too
#sfmusictech @BRYAN_M_COX: when you come into music now you're learning a new business at the same time as joining the business
#sfmusictech @BRYAN_M_COX: there used to be a known process to get into the  music business, that is no longer true it is changing so much
#sfmusictech @BRYAN_M_COX: this is all new even for a guy like me who's been in the business for 20 years
#sfmusictech @smart: we use the session file data to see all the different tracks and stems in the files, so you can distribute them
#sfmusictech @smart: instead of distributing 2 mixed tracks, think of your music as a seed that can spread into different mixes 
#sfmusictech @MusisticChief: we're trying to avoid the music distribution issue and focus on the creation of it - musician to musician
#sfmusictech @ChrisKantrowitz: one thing I've appreciated about the disruption of music is that artists and entrepreneurs are the same thing
#sfmusictech @ChrisKantrowitz: our goal is to build something broad enough that anyone can use it 
#sfmusictech @ChrisKantrowitz: the future of music is "oh shit, there are no rules any more" - it's a golden age of music
#sfmusictech @ChrisKantrowitz: who fucking knows what people are going to do in 5 years with music- artists are smart, they'll work it out
#sfmusictech @ChrisKantrowitz: it's going to be awesome when people have tools in their hand to do shit and not be trapped by the walls
#sfmusictech @BRYAN_M_COX: the record business as we know it is over and we are directly in the middle of the new frontier
#sfmusictech @BRYAN_M_COX: the younger generation has no experience of what purchasing music is
#sfmusictech @BRYAN_M_COX: we need to find a way we can haul music into a revenue model 
#sfmusictech @BRYAN_M_COX: you can't go platinum here but can sell 10M in asia, but they sell digital too
#sfmusictech @BRYAN_M_COX: in asia, even if they are streaming, they still buy records over there and are amazed we don't
#sfmusictech @TRI_Studios: how are you working to get sync licences?
#sfmusictech @ChrisKantrowitz: there are a lot of people working on film scores that sue our product to sync up with quicktime files
#sfmusictech @ChrisKantrowitz: the older companies - the advertising agencies and film companies are still hung up on security
#sfmusictech @ChrisKantrowitz: you need to decide whether you are going to work in enterprise and big iron or in the disruptive world
#sfmusictech @smart: we avoid the big studio model and work with networks of independent or bedroom producers
#sfmusictech @MusisticChief: once people are collaborating with our tool we want to opt into a seedplexing opportunity
#sfmusictech @MusisticChief: we work with 20 different DAWs across mac and windows
#sfmusictech @ChrisKantrowitz: when they were raising money for protools there were only 200 recording studios, so had that as a worldview
#sfmusictech @ChrisKantrowitz: a lot of workflows have been the same for so long - so many walled gardens make it difficult to collaborate
#sfmusictech @ChrisKantrowitz: 20 years ago if you said "I'll share my source code with you" they'd have laughed, we're doing that in music
#sfmusictech @smart: we're seeing a lot of people share their music to teach, to be though leaders
#sfmusictech @smart: other people want to see what others will make from their work
#sfmusictech @smart: we're building a system that rewards you from being more open
#sfmusictech @smart: that sync licence may be out there a few remixes aways 
#sfmusictech @ChrisKantrowitz: if you think how many people go to school to make music it's far more than there are jobs available
#sfmusictech @ChrisKantrowitz: the notion of being proprietary is going away -we share everything now
#sfmusictech @smart: we learned this with source code - we can do more with shared code 
#sfmusictech @smart: educating people on how to use DAWs is hard
#sfmusictech @BRYAN_M_COX: most creatives, we don't read the manual - we just try it out and come up with our own way
#sfmusictech @smart: we open sourced a track from Henry Fong a few weeks ago and someone said they learned so much from it
#sfmusictech @TRI_Studios: what we learned today is "stay in school" and "sharing is good"
#sfmusictech @KimLane: I evangelise APIs - not any one API but all APIs
#sfmusictech @BillHajjar: I'm the CEO of Cinzari a semantic graph based api for music
#sfmusictech @Lamantiini: I'm from music kickup a full service house for artists and labels. we're announcing an API for music dsitribution
#sfmusictech @njyx: I'm the CEO of @3scale we are an API infrastructure company that powers over 500 APIs, including musicmatch jamendo
#sfmusictech @njyx: music has an emotional component which is not there with, say a construction API
#sfmusictech @jzwoo: I work for Braintree - recently bought by paypal we have an easy API that helps you use multiple payment APIs
#sfmusictech @jzwoo: we use a lot of the social APIs like twitter and FB to make sense of the data our customers have
#sfmusictech @Lamantiini: consuming APIs have been crucial for product development; our entire product is built on an internal API
#sfmusictech @Lamantiini: we want the distribution API to be free so we can commoditize distribution to solve licensing and rights issuse
#sfmusictech @Lamantiini: music APIs have grown because the rights issues are complex and you don't want to do something illegal
#sfmusictech @jzwoo: when you see shitty developer documentation, you ask "what were they thinking" - developers are consumers of docs
#sfmusictech @jzwoo: if you put code samples out there people will copy and paste them so they need to be extremely robust
#sfmusictech @3scale: you are creating a dependency between you and the users of the API—if you take it away thats worse than not having it
#sfmusictech @jzwoo: once you release an API people are going to use it forever - there's always someone on the classic API
#sfmusictech @Lamantiini: we were thinking of using the soundcloud API as a way to pull in the music, but it was failing 50% of the time
#sfmusictech @Lamantiini: there is always a business risk involved with depending on someones API
#sfmusictech @Lamantiini: one of the things that is crucial is what am I going to carry on my back, and what can be a partners's API
#sfmusictech @Lamantiini: for example when we give analytics out we use google charts so we don't have to do that part ourselves
