#indieweb @t: Welcome to Homebrew Website Club
#indieweb @t: this last weekend was Indiewebcamp Nürnberg which had a good turnout http://indiewebcamp.com/2016/Nuremberg 
#indieweb @t: A lot of the Nürnberg attendees had been to Indiewebcamp Dusseldorf last year, but about half were new

#indieweb @t: Pelle @voxpelli got a polyfill for web actions working so you can comment on other sites using your own
#indieweb @t: A lot of people got service workers and offline pages working for their own sites
#indieweb @t: We had a very good discussion about homepages and design, which inspired some changes
#indieweb @t: @adactio added sparklines to his homepage to show activity of different kinds of posts
#indieweb @t: a lot of homepages were a stream of recent posts; others were more of a bio
#indieweb @t: I changed my homepage so that when on a narrow screen it links down to the bio stuff at the bottom
#indieweb @t: there's a new site at webmention.rocks for testing webmention support on your site, as part of the @w3c webmention standards
#indieweb @t: webmention.rocks is a validator too as it it gives detailed debugging information in the http response
#indieweb @t: there are 12-13 implementations passing webmention.rocks from ~18 different peopl
