<p>this last weekend was Indiewebcamp Nürnberg which had a good turnout <a class="auto-link" href="http://indiewebcamp.com/2016/Nuremberg">http://indiewebcamp.com/2016/Nuremberg</a> 
<p>A lot of the Nürnberg attendees had been to Indiewebcamp Dusseldorf last year, but about half were new
<p>There were a lot of additions to people's websites and new code read the demos here: <a class="auto-link" href="http://indiewebcamp.com/2016/Nuremberg/Demos">http://indiewebcamp.com/2016/Nuremberg/Demos</a>
<p>Pelle <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/voxpelli">@voxpelli</a> got a polyfill for web actions working so you can comment on other sites using your own
<p>A lot of people got service workers and offline pages working for their own sites
<p>We had a very good discussion about homepages and design, which inspired some changes
<p><a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/adactio">@adactio</a> added sparklines to his homepage to show activity of different kinds of posts
<p>a lot of homepages were a stream of recent posts; others were more of a bio
<p>I changed my homepage so that when on a narrow screen it links down to the bio stuff at the bottom
<p>there's a new site at webmention.rocks for testing webmention support on your site, as part of the <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/w3c">@w3c</a> webmention standards
<p>webmention.rocks is a validator too as it it gives detailed debugging information in the http response
<p>there are 12-13 implementations passing webmention.rocks from ~18 different peopl
<p>There are great photos from IndieWebCamp Nürnberg at <a class="auto-link" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tollwerk/sets/72157664909577964/">https://www.flickr.com/photos/tollwerk/sets/72157664909577964/</a> by <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/iwontsignuphere">@iwontsignuphere</a>
<p>Homebrew Website Club is a fortnightly catch-up where we talk about what we have done on our sites recently
<p>Indiewebcamp is a 2 day long event wheer we talk about ideas and build new things, usually over a weekend
<p>we just got a venue for a second Indiewebcamp NYC at the end of August <a class="auto-link" href="http://indiewebcamp.com/2016/NYC2">http://indiewebcamp.com/2016/NYC2</a> - tell your NY friends
<p>the co-organiser of IWC NYC , Emma Hodge set up her own site <a class="auto-link" href="http://emmahodge.org">http://emmahodge.org</a> at an indiewebcamp

<p>the only persistent identifier is your public key- you can change your name; people can change their name for you
<p>this is built on top of another thing called Secure Scuttlebutt
<p>when I follow a friend on Patchwork I see all the people they follow too

<p>brilliant thing embeds a script inside of the svg tag; but generated numbers inside the tag weren't so pretty
<p>So <a href="svgsparklines.html">I changed it</a> so the URL has the numbers in it, and the script draws it as a polyline <a class="auto-link" href="http://www.kevinmarks.com/sparkline.svg?59,80,80,100,68,62,87,72,42,49,58,53,57,51,42,32,37,30,24,38,57,29,18,32,38,24,24,24,20,21,29,32,26,18,32,36,30,36,29,32,29,28,41,20,28,58,18,24,16,17,22,17,22,21,12,22,14,13,11,20,16,16,18,12,28,28,32,16,16,24,16,20,14,18,12,26,17,11,30,16,9,20,42,13,13,24,17,13,20,12,14,13,14,71,82,20,16,20,22,17,5"><embed src="http://www.kevinmarks.com/sparkline.svg?59,80,80,100,68,62,87,72,42,49,58,53,57,51,42,32,37,30,24,38,57,29,18,32,38,24,24,24,20,21,29,32,26,18,32,36,30,36,29,32,29,28,41,20,28,58,18,24,16,17,22,17,22,21,12,22,14,13,11,20,16,16,18,12,28,28,32,16,16,24,16,20,14,18,12,26,17,11,30,16,9,20,42,13,13,24,17,13,20,12,14,13,14,71,82,20,16,20,22,17,5" width=200 height=16 /></a>
<p>it's really nice if you're posting data on the web, for the data to still be there
<p>(Q: why SVG instead of an regular image?) The nice thing about an SVG is it's really small but scales smoothly
<p>I made <a href="http://svgur.com">svgur.com</a> bc usually to share svgs you have to convert to png and then they'll convert it to a jpeg or something
<p>the nice thing is if you share a link to svgur on Twitter, it generates a bitmap image for the preview
<p>I also updated mention.tech to support the webmention.rocks stuff, which mostly involved simplifying my sending code
