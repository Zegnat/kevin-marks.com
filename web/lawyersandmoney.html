Send lawyers, guns and money

There is a growing disconnect between what lawyers think software is about, and what is actually going on. That may seem banal and platitudinous, but it is costing startups money.
if like me you've worked in Silicon Valley for a while, you'll be used to the rigamarole of employment contracts that attempt to go up to and beyond the law in various ways. The clauses that say this is not intended to violate CA law, the ones that imply non-competes are binding, the Schedule A where you have to list everything you've ever invented (with the implication that otherwise they own it).
I'm almost at the point where I can tell by the boilerplate which law firm wrote the agreement.
