#xoxofest @waxpancake: This is an experimental festival, so things go wrong. I hope you bear  with us 
#xoxofest @waxpancake: It is an experimental festival about independent art and technology,  but about the challenges as well assuccesses
#xoxofest @waxpancake: Talking about imposter syndrome, anxiety and harassment , not cynicism and snark 
#xoxofest @andymcmillan: Most 9f today's schedule was created by the slack channels, not II us
#xoxofest @andymcmillan: If we do another one we could let you make up the whole schedule and we can relax
#xoxofest @andymcmillan: This is not a tech conference, we use the whole word  technology. 
#xoxofest @andymcmillan: Female identified attendees are up to 45% this year, people of colour 20% -  the diversity question  really helped 
#xoxofest @andymcmillan: @ashedryden was a huge help with all the diversity work this year. We are forever in her debt 
#xoxofest @andymcmillan: We have patrons rather  than sponsors - you aren't being handed zip drives and beer cosies with logos on 
#xoxofest @andymcmillan: Mailchimp helped us brew  our own beer, so we are on a beer label now 
#xoxofest @andymcmillan: We brewed our own beer, but we also have a dedicated non alcohol bar thanks to slack, named with emoji 
#xoxofest @waxpancake: If something is wrong and we're neglecting, let us know. Give us a chance to fix it 
#xoxofest @andymcmillan: We have a court Stenographer transcribing all the talks for medium of you want quotations for your posts 
#xoxofest @waxpancake: Every one gets a water bottle canteen and field notes. There is a word secondary market for those on eBay 
#xoxofest @andymcmillan: We also have a choice of conduct, which is a very good idea. Almost everyone agrees with this. 
#xoxofest @andymcmillan: If you want to report anything, come to us or to people in staff shirts. We have removed badges from peeps before 
#xoxofest @andymcmillan: We have reserved quiet spaces on the roof and in the bar inside the 2nd floor 
#xoxofest @waxpancake: This is a festival largely composed of introverts, so don't feel weird
 about talking to people here
