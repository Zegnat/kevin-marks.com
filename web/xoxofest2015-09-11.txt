#xoxofest @waxpancake: there are times when I curate things for xoxo that really speak to me, and suck.com is one of those
#xoxofest @waxpancake: They wee the only ones poking fun while everyone was investing in garbage and driving valuations up
#xoxofest @waxpancake: they wrote one post a day in a narrow column in courier full of links  -the 1st collaboration 14 year since suck died
#xoxofest @JoeyAnuff: most people who collaborate grow to hate one anothers' guts - that's the dramatic arc
#xoxofest @JoeyAnuff: Andy told us we'd have the greatest density of suck fans ever assembled in one place
#xoxofest @guydeboredom: and on the other hand, that no-one would remember who we are
#xoxofest @JoeyAnuff: we ended up representing the web -sometime that's the only chance you get, to fill in the gaping content hole
#xoxofest @JoeyAnuff: All the fun was done by the time we got to 2000. I was on the national committee on intellectual property rights
#xoxofest @JoeyAnuff: Another hero of mine - an unironic hero - @aaronsw. I was so touched that he put up a full archive of suck
#xoxofest @JoeyAnuff: When Aaron got busted for the JSTOR heist, I thought that was a really worthy thing to do
#xoxofest @guydeboredom: when you are building this digital archive, do you think you are leaving a legacy?
#xoxofest @guydeboredom: I confessed to Joey that I have every commercial font ever, but I really like Caslon
#xoxofest @guydeboredom: If you ever see my things, even if it is just twitter, you should see them in Caslon
#xoxofest @JoeyAnuff: Is Caslon a script font? Oh, wait, I am thinking of Papyrus
#xoxofest @guydeboredom: You know, joey, there were times I was so glad you did not succeed
#xoxofest @JoeyAnuff: that reminds me of when Ev Williams came to us at Automatic and I thought he might succeed, and I didn't like that
#xoxofest @JoeyAnuff: The Kim Dotcom era 2009-2001
#xoxofest @waxpancake: i don't listen to many podcatss - I don't have a commute - but TL;DR became a must-listen to me at once
#xoxofest @PJVogt: Tim Howard: do you guys want this? [plays them song sting]
#xoxofest @PJVogt: we host story about the internet - tonight we talk about a place where people try destroy other people's businesses: Yelp
#xoxofest @AGoldmund: "at the end of the play the audience was so stunned, we didn't realise we were supposed to clap until an actor bowed"
#xoxofest @AGoldmund: this is the crazy thing about "Perfect crime" - it is the worst reviewed play on the net, and it has run for 28 years
#xoxofest @PJVogt: We tried to answer the question "how can you keep a one and a half star play running for almost 3 decades?" and "why?"
#xoxofest @PJVogt: When you leave the theatre they hand you an answer key that inlcudes questions like "who killed whom?"
#xoxofest @AGoldmund: we had a meeting the other day
#xoxofest @PJVogt: a two hour meeting about a tweet about our radio show
#xoxofest @AGoldmund: Catherine says she works 16 hour days - she takes tickets; she cleans the theatre, so she can be with other actors
#xoxofest @PJVogt: everyone here at XOXO is working on something dumb with their friends that they feel helpful about
