<p><a class='h-card' href='http://bleeds.info/'>Randall Leeds</a>:  <blockquote><p>Annotations are additions - links, block quotes, inline - microformats and microdata; out of band webmention + pingback
<p>we want annotations to be decentralized, so they need to interoperate with a data model and component models
<p>We are going to need syndication and discovery for annotations 
<p>we want a more read/write web - we deserve the freedom to reference, not overload URI syntax forever
<p>how do we go from out of band to inline? How do you show a remote annotation in the text you're reading
<p>existing event targets are DOM element, but we want to target the data -the text of the page idea: event.dataTarget
<p>how about a selection pseudo element - can we describe a selection, style it and not modify the DOM - like a:visited
<p>we need feed discovery - Activity Streams. Also we need to publish locally and use WebMention <a class="auto-link" href="http://indiewebcamp.com/webmention">http://indiewebcamp.com/webmention</a>
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.cgallello.com'>Chris Gallello</a>:  <blockquote><p>I'm PM on Office Online, working on accessibility - we have annotations in Office and visual studio already
<p>red underlines in Word and breakpoints in Visual Studio are annotations form our point of view [machine generated]
<p>we've been thinking about how to connect screen readers to annotations - to know there is one, to jump in and out
<p>we can use an aria.annotationtype of "comment" and point to the element with the comment with aria.annotatedby
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://github.com/AnnaGerber'>Anna Gerber</a>:  <blockquote><p>Annotation is used throughout the research process, and for teaching not just as part of publications
<p>researchers need to annotate maps, 3D spaces, protein models, sensor data streams , textual variants
<p>scholary annotation requirements: citable; precise; of segments/regions; many data types; within dynamic web apps
<p>we need to migrate annotations across multiple copies of identical resources, or modified ones
<p>stand-off annotation is needed to maintain integrity of original resources
<p>we use the Annotea, OA model so have shared generic backend, but need protocols and APIs too
<p>the OA model is extremely flexible, but diffciult to implement as the queries are hard to write
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://seanboisen.com'>Sean Boisen</a>:  <blockquote><p>Logos is a digital library for biblical studies, with very rich annotation and cross referencing tools
<p>our app is not out on the web, but a desktop app you download.
<p>Bible has book/chapter/verse and we add word, but they are different between some bibles
<p>we care about cross-lingual word alignment for annotations, which requires extra standardizations
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://whiteink.com'>Nick Stenning</a>:  <blockquote><p>data models are simple; protocols harder, but user interactions are hard enough that we'd take us years to agree
<p>a bookmarklet is basically a cross-site scripting attack. A standard known as content security policy breaks them
<p>Browser extensions are not standardised - every user agent has its own extension model
<p>Does anyone know for proposals to allow user-trusted code to run in the DOM in a standard way? Nope
<p>we either need to spec ALL the things, or build for pluralism so there are many ways to do it
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.linkedin.com/pub/james-williamson/4/324/66b'>James Williamson</a>:  <blockquote><p>As a publisher, having notes you take on Kindle not translating to ibooks is really annoying
<p>we get complaints from readers all the time about the "1000 people marked this page" stuff in Kindle 
<p>we do pop-ups of footnotes and publication history in our online journals
<p>we have third party annotations from reference management and social media crawling
<p>the only way to annotate our works is with the "contact us" button that emails the publisher- can take 2 years
<p>we have multiple different annotations at different levels of the publishing process paper/Word/PDF
<p>we have extensive annotations in our new journals online product , and for assignments and quizzes
<p>what happens to annotations when content has been deleted? Or out of print? [odd concept for web]
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.fjhirsch.com/'>Frederick Hirsch</a>:  <blockquote><p>people annotate books but also movies and sound too where you have to point at timestamps
<p>teachers comment on student assignments and students can respond inline
<p>provenance of annotations is important - this brings in identity issues. Iterating them is also hard
<p>I don't think we should rework the Open Annotation data model, but we need RESTful search and JSON-LD output
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://github.com/AnnaGerber'>Anna Gerber</a>:  <blockquote><p>we have covered the data model but not the protocol. 
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='#'>Timothy Cole</a>:  <blockquote><p>for scholarly text we need individual words and phrases as anchors, even when adjacent content is updated
<p>correction of OCR and manual transcriptions, and of automated part-of-speech tagging
<p>we need proposed corrections to be able to be reviewed and annotated themselves
<p>for example we annotate the scan with the original OCR and the OCR with the corrections
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@EricAubourg'>Eric Aubourg</a>:  <blockquote><p>STM is a small publisher with complex texts including arabic, hebrew and heiroglyphics
<p>our policy is ePub firts, no DRM, one purchase for all formats
<p>we have ePub with interactive maps of the Karnak temple that link to images of the wall paintings
<p>referencing other works is required for scholarly publications, but page number doesn't work across editions
<p>for epub we need something user-raedable and reader-processable - people like "page 23" not ids
<p>we need it to be independent of paper, pdf, epub that can survive reflowing, and human readable
<p>in epub you can mark the page boundaries of the original document in the HTML but doesn't go the other way
<p>numbered paragraphs within chapters can work for finished works -  easy to quote
<p>we need readable shortcuts, not 64-character hashes - like link shorteners
<p>we want the target refernce to be human processable
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://kevinmarks.com'>Kevin Marks</a>:  <blockquote><p>q: isn't a quotation from the work the most robust reference across paper+ edocs 10 words are unique?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@EricAubourg'>Eric Aubourg</a>:  <blockquote><p>yes, quotation is good and robust, and human readable, but it can be a bit long 
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://fchasen.com'>Fred Chasen</a>:  <blockquote><p>the interactions in the various different document viewers are cumbersome and inconsistent
<p>creating the notes content first and then anchoring to the document makes more sense
<p>robust note authoring shouldn't block what you are annotating. It should let you re-anchor after composition
<p>we need to account for longer notes, that may be longer than the entire text
<p>also define print styles for CSS so that users can print out the whole thing
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@KristofCsillag'>Kristof Csillag</a>:  <blockquote><p>at <a class="auto-link" href="http://Hypothes.is">Hypothes.is</a> we're working on an annotation system for the web and we have proposed solutions
<p> annotating web documentsnis good, but we added PDF, Epub and would like to add scribd and google docs too
<p>we define a target with generic selectors xpath, but also text position and text content selectors 
<p>by having multiple selectors we can use fuzzy matching to find the parts we want
<p>there is a problem with dynamic sites, we need dynamic anchoring - comments can be oprhaned
<p>knowing what is actually the target across documents can be very hard
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://kevinmarks.com'>Kevin Marks</a>:  <blockquote><p>if you remove annotations when the document referenced is edited can't unfavourable ones be removed?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@KristofCsillag'>Kristof Csillag</a>:  <blockquote><p>yes, but we can keep orphaned annotations and possibly keep old versions
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://github.com/AnnaGerber'>Anna Gerber</a>:  <blockquote><p>how do you cope with copyright issues of keeping quotations?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://twitter.com/@KristofCsillag'>Kristof Csillag</a>:  <blockquote><p>right now we don't care about copyright - we are focused on making the annotations robust
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://whiteink.com'>Nick Stenning</a>:  <blockquote><p>there are difficult problems around how you display disappeared content to the user, and how to reanchor
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Ã‡elik</a>:  <blockquote><p>the anchoring problem is important - cool URLs don't change
<p>question the assumption of annotation providers, how about self-hosted annotation, anchor and context too
<a class='h-card' href='http://kevinmarks.com'>Kevin Marks</a>:  <blockquote><p>we should standardize multiple anchor formats - link, cite, text, image, audio snippet rather than how to be fuzzy
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='https://github.com/AnnaGerber'>Anna Gerber</a>:  <blockquote><p>when thinking about anchoring, focus on the content, not just the document format
