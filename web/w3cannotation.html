<p>we want annotations to be decentralized, so they need to interoperate with a data model and component models
<p>We are going to need syndication and discovery for annotations 
<p>we want a more read/write web - we deserve the freedom to reference, not overload URI syntax forever
<p>how do we go from out of band to inline? How do you show a remote annotation in the text you're reading
<p>existing event targets are DOM element, but we want to target the data -the text of the page idea: event.dataTarget
<p>how about a selection pseudo element - can we describe a selection, style it and not modify the DOM - like a:visited
<p>we need feed discovery - Activity Streams. Also we need to publish locally and use WebMention <a class="auto-link" href="http://indiewebcamp.com/webmention">http://indiewebcamp.com/webmention</a>

<a class='h-card' href='http://www.cgallello.com'>Chris Gallello</a>:  <blockquote><p>I'm PM on Office Online, working on accessibility - we have annotations in Office and visual studio already
<p>red underlines in Word and breakpoints in Visual Studio are annotations form our point of view [machine generated]
<p>we've been thinking about how to connect screen readers to annotations - to know there is one, to jump in and out
<p>we can use an aria.annotationtype of "comment" and point to the element with the comment with aria.annotatedby

<a class='h-card' href='https://github.com/AnnaGerber'>Anna Gerber</a>:  <blockquote><p>Annotation is used throughout the research process, and for teaching not just as part of publications
<p>researchers need to annotate maps, 3D spaces, protein models, sensor data streams , textual variants
<p>scholary annotation requirements: citable; precise; of segments/regions; many data types; within dynamic web apps
<p>we need to migrate annotations across multiple copies of identical resources, or modified ones
<p>stand-off annotation is needed to maintain integrity of original resources
<p>we use the Annotea, OA model so have shared generic backend, but need protocols and APIs too
<p>the OA model is extremely flexible, but diffciult to implement as the queries are hard to write

<a class='h-card' href='http://seanboisen.com'>Sean Boisen</a>:  <blockquote><p>Logos is a digital library for biblical studies, with very rich annotation and cross referencing tools
<p>our app is not out on the web, but a desktop app you download.
<p>Bible has book/chapter/verse and we add word, but they are different between some bibles
<p>we care about cross-lingual word alignment for annotations, which requires extra standardizations
