<p><a class='h-card' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>IndieWebCamp UK was amazing - I've never seen so many people go from 0 to 5 HTTPS in one weekend
<p>the documentation on the wiki helped a lot, Also Tim Retout was interpreting the crypto error messages everyone was getting
<p><a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/adactio">@adactio</a> had a great socratic dialog with Tim drawing out the complexities of https
<p>on Monday Google said they will deprecate SHA-1 in a year, so the HTTPS effort gets to be redone for SHA-2
<p>also at indiewebcamp UK was a complete user flow for going to someone else's site, clicking a reply button and post it to you
<p>by using an indie-action tag, which delegates via a protocol handler that you register for your own site to your site
<p>have you seen Barnaby's <a class="auto-link" href="http://shrewdness.waterpigs.co.uk">shrewdness.waterpigs.co.uk</a> reader? it subscribes only to h-entry markup
<p>to subscribe to a legacy RSS or Atom feed via shrewdness use <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/kevinmarks">@kevinmarks</a>'s <a class="auto-link" href="http://feed.unmung.com">feed.unmung.com</a> to convert them to h-entry

<a class='h-card' href='http://werd.io/'>Ben Werdmüller</a>:  <blockquote><p>I need to dash back as we're launching <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/withknown">@withknown</a> tomorrow, go to <a class="auto-link" href="http://withknown.com">withknown.com</a> to get your own indieweb site
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://aaronparecki.com'>Aaron Parecki</a>:  <blockquote><p>new member Joe Myer with <a class="auto-link" href="http://sportsdatabase.com/">http://sportsdatabase.com/</a> - here to learn
<p>next new member is at <a class="auto-link" href="http://yourmom.io">yourmom.io</a> 
<p>I got some new things working - I added video posts to my site as I had to post a screen recording
<p>I have a new thing that plays an mp4 file if you post it, and I'm just using the &lt;video&gt; tag so it just works
<p>also this week I got bookmarks working on my site - go to <a class="auto-link" href="http://quill.p3k.io">quill.p3k.io</a> you can use it to post bookmarks too

<a class='h-card' href='http://kevinmarks.com'>Kevin Marks</a>:  <blockquote><p>today <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/benwerd">@benwerd</a> <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/erinjo">@erinjo</a> and I went on This Week In Google to talk about indieweb and Known
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>Leo was very excited to be able to post photos from his phone to known
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://aaronparecki.com'>Aaron Parecki</a>:  <blockquote><p>it was also great to show comments from multiple implementations on the Known site to show interop
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote><p>the nice thing about this #indieweb demo was that previous monoculture implementations only interoperated with themselves
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://upon2020.com/'>Johannes Ernst</a>:  <blockquote><p>we have changed indiebox into a project <a class="auto-link" href="http://ubos.net">ubos.net</a>  to deploy services on various different servers on demand
<p>what we have not built in the indie world is products that people can buy
